so I find out what happens
what kind of bird is cupid
heart passionate captivate
confess and I fall in love
time flies by happiness
how love does not know the burden
I live and sing
like going to the theatre and to a ball
for a walk or to the vauxhall
light marshmallow fly
how to laugh in evil cupid
I write a cartoon
to the lovely female sex
but I laugh in vain
finally get caught myself
I'm going crazy myself, alas
laughter liberty all under the bench
I'm resigning from the Catons
and now I'm celadon
pretty priestess talia
see the beauty of natalia
and already in the heart of Cupid
so natalia i confess
I will captivate you
I'm still embarrassed for the first time
in love with feminine charm
all day long no matter how I turn
only you occupy me
night come and only you
I see in an empty dream
see in light clothing
as if he were cute with me
timidly sweet breath
white chest wobble
snow eclipse whiteness
and a half-open eye
modest darkness silent night
bring my spirit into rapture
I'm alone in the gazebo with her
see virgin lily
tremble languish become dumb
and wake up to see darkness
around the bed lonely
let out a deep sigh
sleep lazy languid
take off on the wing
passion becomes strong
and love will get tired
I get weaker every hour
everyone strives for something
and why none of us
the lady can't say it out loud
and smear it this way and that
I explain myself in a friendly manner
all lover desire
and the one that doesn't know
this is the property they marvel at
wrap up hoodie
with a smart hat on the side
I would like to Philemon
in the evening there is shadow everywhere
take anyuta nezhinat hand
explain the pain of love
say she's mine
I would like to see Nazar
you tried i
hold a tender gaze
or the gray guardian
easy cute rosina
old stepson fate
in an epancha and with a wig
daring fiery hand
snow white full chest
I wish I could
do not step over the sea
and even fall head over heels in love
but to separate from you
I deprive all my hope
but natalia you don't know
who is your tender celadon
you don't understand yet
why shouldn't he dare
and hope Natalia
I still have to listen
I am not the owner of the seraglio
I am neither an Arab nor a Turk
for the polite Chinese
rude american
I can't read it
not to imagine and Germans
with a cap on the hair
pour beer from a mug
and with a cigarette in the tooth
do not represent the cavalry guard
in a helmet with a long sword
I don't like the thunder of battle
sword sabre halberd
don't drag my hand
for Adam's sin
who are you, chatterbox in love
look at the wall sublime
where there is silence, eternal darkness
look at the windows barred
there is a lamp lit there
know Natalia I am a monk
want to sing like an unclean spirit hell
saddle be a bearded old man
how to master he black hood
how he pushes the sinful monk into the herd
singer love ferney old man
to you voltaire i now address
where to say your bow go
which I admire in Jean d'Arc
where is your brush, I wonder forever
they can't find a single person
voltaire sultan french parnassus
I don't want to saddle a Pegasus horse
I don't want to make something out of the muse
but I will give only your golden lyre
I be with her the whole known world
you frown and say don't give
and you are a damned poet Apollo
dirty the partition wall of the tavern
fall into the mud from Villon under Helicon
can't you help me bark
with a grin give you I'm a violin
promise wine and the muse is half a maiden
just follow my example
no no barks skripitsa can't be taken
I start singing whatever comes into my head
let it flow verse by verse somehow
not far from that beautiful place
where the daring ivan the great will rise
wear a golden cross on your head
into the wilderness forest in desert gloomy wild
there is a monastery in the deaf its wall
in old age one year gray-haired monk
saint life prayer to be saved
and the day is calmly approaching its end
our worker is not too rich
for his pomp he cannot go to hell
have a cat have a psalter and a rosary
cowl, sticharion and decanter, green vodka
ascend to the house where the monk lives peacefully
not gold to see you mountain
it would not be marble there to tempt your gaze
there is no Raphael hanging on the wall
If only you could see a three-legged chair
yes, in the corner there is a bench half an arshin high
why sleep and have breakfast monk
there is a down jacket over the bench, so it doesn't bulge
although he is a monk, he is not one to roll around in fluff
between two sheets on a soft mattress
the holy father fasts all year round
he spends all day long in his cell
have mercy on me read in a low voice
eat, sleep soundly and pray every hour
and you are a rebellious Jesuit monk
red now if you can blush
if you have at least a drop of conscience
red and you are a rich carmelite
and you are ashamed of the Pechersk Lavra resident
heart and soul humble master
but the lyre is too far to carry
I'm already against duckweed zeal
annoying priests is not our craft
pankraty live happy in solitude
hope to see paradise soon
but no land is an unknown region
We can't protect ourselves from the devil
and to the place where the black Satan is
under guard from anger claw gnaw
suddenly find out what to uncover
to the monastery free road
and suddenly the crowd all hell rises
to fly through the air on the wing
another in Paris to the bald Carthusian
from a kopeck to a chervonets to climb
that one in the Vatican to the pot-bellied Italian
Burgundy and macaroons to carry
that girl with the prelate will fall
that young man goes to the nun
and I hear that it’s like an old priest
one foot is already entering the coffin
two young people marry in front of the lectern
the devil come running with a whole swarm of cupids
and suddenly the deacon began to snore on the wing
priest keep silent look at the girl
and the girl looks at the deacon
The groom's blood began to boil
and they lead the whole demon to hell themselves
it's already dark night and the sky is rising
the city's daily noise has already died down
moon in the window monk light
direct your entire mind to the prayer book
pankraty our nicholas before the icon
bow down to the earth with a sigh
come milk so the devil call
pankraty hide under black duckweed
holy monk pray pray
sigh sigh and the devil is right there
beat an hour milk don't want to let go
beat two beat three unclean all sit
Well, he'll be the one to grumble at himself
and our old man has already stopped crossing himself
sit on a bench rub your eye yawn
stretch out three times with prayer
yawn again and almost fall asleep
however, there is no pankraty suddenly waking up
and again the demon monk tempts
to put beavers to sleep become read
monk to be bored monk to be amazed
never yawns like a god he prays
but there is no power cross psalter word
forget everything gray head
like an apple rolling up to your chest
from forehead to knee to drop
prayer book fall out of hand under table
holy take a nap snore like an old ox
unhappy sleeping pankraty suddenly wake up
back and forth with fear of looking back
cross yourself from bed he gets up
look around the lamp burn
a slightly weak light shines around itself
something in the corner seemed to turn white
monk go what skirt see he
what am i seeing or is it just a dream
cry out monk become dumbfounded turn pale
how is that and don't dare continue
as dug in before the white skirt becomes
keep quiet blush be embarrassed tremble
fire love the only obstacle
lover sweet reward
and charm is the only cover
about skirt speech to you i turn
I dedicate this line to you
animate the pen my love
love you oh skirt dear
when I expect it in the evening
Natalia taking off her brocade sarafan
you just surround the thin camp
what can be then you are cute
and you hang around beautiful leg
stream stream transparent light
touch the place where the young god is
rest between the rose and the lily
or like Philo, run after Chloe
she presses her in an embrace strives
green bush you suddenly hold
she should be ashamed to stop
but it's too late to catch up with her
with her on the fragrant grass to fall
and the fiery hand trembled
happy love shepherd
you lift it quietly by the edge
she he grin languidly
and he but no dare not continue
I tremble and my heart beats strongly
and maybe be a reader who knows
and your blood with the desire and passion to flow
but our monk is talking about a skirt
not like me, I'm young, I don't cut my hair
and happiness does not offend at all
he won't be happy to see the skirt
and at the same time to figure out and guess
that he will fall into the unclean claw
the night has not yet departed
for now the moon still sheds light
then the skirt will still be visible
how soon will the firmament be illuminated by dawn
she suddenly disappeared from view
and our monk, alas, is deprived of peace
he doesn't sleep, he doesn't pet, he's a cat
he doesn't remember the church service
Pankraty is in trouble all over the place
how does he think when he is a little dog
I go to the monastery and my spirit is gone
when you've never seen a skirt here before
who can she bring to me in the house
I already think I forgive the lord at that
Isn't there something to be afraid of here, girl?
monk blush and do what not to know
search the entire corner under the bench
all in vain there is nothing for the old man to stay with
but all day long I'll be dragging around like a pale shadow
do not eat do not drink calmly and do not sleep
day passes and evening comes
light a lamp and a candle everywhere
the monk is already taking off his cowl from his head
go to bed but just now ray
he let the moon from the sky into the window
and the skirt suddenly illuminates the bench
squint alarm monk
and so as not to somehow fall into temptation
want to lose sight forever
just so I don't look at the skirt
old man groan roll over on his side
and wrap yourself in a warm sheet
close your eyes fall asleep and start snoring
that hour the milk suddenly turns into a fly
and fly buzzing around it
fly fly around the room spin
and my monk sits on my nose
Pankrat again he tempt to let go
monk snore and see a wonderful dream
it seemed like he was in the middle of a valley
between the flower stand under the myrtle he
around him satyr faun host
another laughs pouring foamy wine into a cup
green ivy on black hair
and grapes hang on the head
and a light firza at his feet to lie
everyone says that the eternally youthful Bacchus
fun god satire patron
another one blows the shepherd's pipe
sing love and heart master
to animate his cheerful trill
dance in a circle under the linden tree
crowd child and youth and maiden
and then a branch under the dark vault
in the dense shade of a spreading tree
on the bed rose love inflamed
breathe a little fun exhausted
amid joy and sweet coolness
hugging lover lie
the monk looks at everything with a troubled eye
then he turns his gaze to the glass
then the monk looked at the girl with a sigh
bald forehead with annoyance to scratch
stand there like a stump with your mouth wide open
and suddenly in the soul I feel courage
and pull the hood over his head to the side
into the green forest like a white-whiskered page
like a light horse chasing a girl
fast eagle fast sound lyre
the beauty flies like a marshmallow
but our monk Aeolus seems to be in front of her
without rest for a new daphne to chase
don't let me grumble I missed the ring
but the goblin suddenly flashed from behind the bushes
pankrat grab a skirt in the face
and suddenly the pleasant view of the forests disappears
the stream hill and the nymph do not see him
the faun no longer flutters and cupid
and there is no trace of the lovely beauty
a monk alone in the steppe, deaf and unknown
frown darken the sky
suddenly thunder strikes monk strikes
pankraty ah and suddenly he wakes up
he turned his confused gaze everywhere
to the sky like a hyacinth grief
the east is already blushing with dawn
and the skirt no pankraty get up wash
and when he prays he starts crying loudly
sit under the window and grieve bitterly
ah to think he's angry why you
that you are guilty, master, before you
as a sinner I twist the unclean
want not to sleep want you to pray
take the psalter and suddenly a skirt
want to take a nap and forget about the night sleep
why do I dream, my spirit is confused
hear my earnest prayer
Lord, do not let me fall into temptation
hear god prayer old man
and his mind will be enlightened in a minute
from a poor gray simpleton
Pankraty suddenly turns into Newton
think over look compare figure out
and to overturn the chair for joy
and how the wise man who syracuse to save
running down the street barefoot and naked
he admires his discovery
and loudly shout everything find find
Well, I think he's from a devil and a skirt
I and my sweet girl get rid of
I don't want to tempt you into sleep anymore
I will live again monk monk
I'm starting to wait the last hour with fear
and with faith and everything will go well
that's how he thinks and he's very wrong
can rock universe lord
Pankraty is playing like a doll
monk water fill his jug
mutter over he word prayer
and be ready for a terrible hell battle
wait skirt he with his own side
unclean spirit to be at work all day
and all in heat, in dirt, in dust and sweat
warn hurry rise moon
oh why am i wonderful nature
Correggio the art of not giving
then the Parnassian people would be included
I can't bring a dashing passion
I wouldn't want to stain my finger with ink
do not litter the attic with paper
and at the desk like a girl at a hoop
I would never sit down to write a poem
I would take the brush with a fearless hand
and drink a glass of champagne in an instant
I would like to work hard and get a hot head
like tsitsian or fiery alban
I would like to present all the charm of Natalia
I would like to let a strand of hair fall down onto my chest
around the head a wreath of fragrant roses
around cute leg clothes playful waist
the camp embrace cypris b belt gold
and the brush would be happy I a hundred times
or paint b take return or pussin
wave river flow would canvas
the scorching southern sky
raise the night with a brooding moon
would represent over the gray rock
around which the ocean beats and makes noise
high moss cover wall
and there in the wave where the breeze breathes
on silver around rock shiny foam
marshmallow swing shuttle
I would like to draw in he I am Cantemir
her beauty and would be glad to throw the lyre
from the pure muse to depart forever
but rubens i was not born into the world
not to draw I rhyme to weave to start
Martynov let us captivate the brush
and I will climb up Parnassus again
to be fulfilled by the heroic courage
take the inkwell and paper again
and I become again the song continues
what to do now gray pankraty
what to do and his hairy enemy
already stop Phoebus earth illuminate
shadows are already flying in from all sides
fog obscured the view of the grove and forest
here and there even a star shines
and the moon already flashed through the forest
neither alive nor dead to sit under the icon
black man pray with both hands
and suddenly it's white as snow falls again
Moscow river on rocky bank
as a light shadow in the eye appear skirt
monk rise like a flame turn red
how cute modinka ala sponge
grab the jug all the anger flare up
and all the water he poured on his skirt
oh miracle, in an instant this ghost disappears
and here he is before me with horns and tail
like a grey wolf, bristles cover everything
like a good horse with a shoed hoof
to appear milk to tremble under the table
pour water all over from head to toe

and Aglinsky's carriage amazes everyone
go and sweat at Shilovskiy
napping at the bitter end of dinner
to Naryshkin to straighten the vest
then all the nobility with the minister with the prince
because to live with a blood friend

for everything, there is a ready reward
repent servant evil demon
a minute to give you a chance to explain

and I will take you to Jerusalem

to Jerusalem yes yes take you

but remember that it's not for nothing
you lay your venerable foot
keep keep always straight road
after all, the road to dark hell is wide
arist and you in the crowd servant parnassus
you want to ride a stubborn pegasus
to rush for laurels is a dangerous path
and boldly enter into battle with strict criticism
aristocrat to verify you I leave pen ink
forget stream forest sad grave
in the cold song love does not burn
so as not to fly off the mountain and step down quickly
enough without you poet to be and to be
they print and forget the whole world
be able to now move away from the noise
and unite with the stupid muse forever
under the peaceful canopy of Minervina Aegis
hide another father second telemachid
fear the fate of the senseless singer
we kill the community verse
descendant of late tribute poet fair
there will be laurels on the pinnacle but there will also be nettles
fear dishonor what is apollo
hear that you too will climb the helicon
shake curly head with disdain
your genius is to reward the saving vine
but why are you frowning and ready to answer
perhaps I should say I don't waste an extra word
when I decide on something I will never back down
and to know my lot is to fall I am the lyre to choose
let me judge how I want the whole world
get angry shout swear but I'm still a poet
an aristocrat is not a poet who can weave rhymes
and do not spare the pen when scratching the paper
a good poem is not so easy to write
how wittgenstein french win
meanwhile how dmitriev derzhavin lomonosov
singer immortal and honor and glory to ross
nourish the healthy mind and learn together
how many times does a book die when it is barely born
creation of loud rithmatov graphs
with heavy bibrus to rot in the glazunov
no one remembers they don't become nonsense to read
and the Phoebes on they curse the seal
to believe that having climbed the pind happily
poet can you be called rightly
then you will read everything with pleasure
but do you think that the river is already flowing towards you?
for being a poet you are an immeasurable wealth
that you are already taking over the state
bury a gold coin in an iron chest
and lie on your side, eat and sleep peacefully
not so kind friend writer rich
fate he did not give neither marble chamber
nor pure gold to fill the chest
hut underground high attic
here is their magnificent palace, a magnificent hall
poet praise all feed only magazine
roll past their fortune wheel
to be born naked and to step naked into the grave russo
Camoes with beggar spread share
fires in the attic to die unknown
hand alien grave betrayed he
their life row grief thundering glory dream
You seem to be thinking a little now
Well, what can I say judging everything so strictly?
go through everything like a new juvenile
you about poetry with me to interpret
and he himself quarreled with the Parnassian sister
I preach come here verse
what will happen to you, are you sane or not?
aristocrat without a word here is my answer
in the village I remember with a simple layman
the priest is elderly and has gray curls
in peace with neighbors in honor of contentment to live
and the first sage has long been known as the whole
once drain the bottle and glass
he went to the wedding in the evening a little drunk
he came across a man
listen father say simpleton
teach us sinner we are you to forbid drinking
be sober everyone always command
and believe we you and what today yourself
listen say priest man
as you teach in church, so you must act
Living well and I don't imitate
and I had to answer
I don't want to justify myself at all
happy who does not feel the desire to verse
spend a quiet life without grief and without worries
your ode journal do not burden
and don't sit over an impromptu for a week
he doesn't like to walk on the height of parnassus
do not seek pure muse nor ardent pegasus
he with pen in hand does not frighten the frame
calm cheerful he is an aristocrat he does not sing
but stop arguing, be afraid, you're boring
and you torment the satirical pen
Now my dear friend I will give you advice
whether to let the flute fall silent or not
think about everything and choose any
be nice good calm good twice
source fast calomon
run to the distant shore
I see your indignant wave
muddy stream along the rock
when the night star shines
through the dozing deserted forest
make noise and irrigate the root
weave a tree into a dark shelter
your mossy shore love koln
when the shadow pours across the sky
you mature when in love involuntarily
here is a friend of Koln to give himself up
the king of selma can enter the palace
Toskar the young broadcast
to shake into the darkness of the dense forest
where is the crown rolling black shaft
make noise cool aspen
there is a row of graves there
there with a faithful brave squad
shelf enemy i waste
and many many strong jaws
their coffin black raven shred
shake and where they do not become
erect a monument to victory
he is a river and on an unknown distant path
to start with the bard Toskar
go into the darkness night sad
in the evening chill in the midday heat
red morning star
golden morning in the sky
and now Toskar is approaching
to the place where in the dark forest
run gray source crown
and hide in the sleepy valley
the bard sings a hymn to the saint
toskar fragment mountain flint
strong powerful hand
draw from the abyss wave silver
and with noise on the high bank
to plunge into thick and wild grass
he hangs black armor on it
cover blood ancestor sword
and a round shield and a feathered helmet
and he turns his speech to the stone
broadcast son noisy stream
oh brave late time
yes, at a terrible hour like deep night
to lie down in the fog in the forest
stranger dear tire
lie down under a safe shelter
remember the distant century
in dreaming sweet light sleep
with the scarlet dawn of the morning
ray of sun awaken
he beheld the gloomy tomb
and a menacing appearance to strike
ask the son of a stranger
who will erect an arrogant monument
and the old man bent over in years
says our unforgettable Toskar
hero rush time
sky hide eternal inhabitant
the dawn fades into the sky
moon in the air abode
rush to the dark cloud
already night on the hill bank crown
fall asleep in the surrounding grove
Lord strong calomon
foreign friend karul
Summon Morven Hero
in the dwelling of Koln young
taste pleasantness peace
and drink from a circular cup
Near the ashes all sit
joy bard song sing
and in the foam a golden cup
steep rush sequence
sad only alien lore
head to the chest to bow
thoughtfully he passionate look
to reap to prick to direct
and his chest sighs heavily
in the eye the joy shine fades
then the fire runs along the member
then the bliss of languishing spirit
to yearn secretly feel
excitement strong in the blood
to gaze upon the youthful charm
he is a full cup to drink love
but now the oak tree has stopped smoking
and the shadow becomes dark
the dim sky darkens
and reign in the hall of sleep
thinning night dawn crimson
ray of sunshine to raise
before her the golden firmament is rosy
Toskar leave bed sleep
fast flowing calomone
walk along the wet shore
hurry to see the valley crown
and listen to the splashing waves
and suddenly from the canopy a dark grove
like the spring midnight hour
from the clouds a golden moon
go out young warrior
sharp sword on the thigh to shine
spear right hand arm
pull a helmet over one's forehead
and flexible frame to cover the shield
the dawn of armor turns silver
through the morning into the valley of steam
O young warrior River Toscar
what enemy are you fighting
Is there a war in this country too?
crimson stream flowing wave
but everything is calm and quiet
the neighborhood of the dwelling is a gentle ring
calm wilds of calomon
bloom fatherland golden land
but if you don't live there
and now on a blind path
desert with cute flow
captivate the heart beauty
what a river you are I am a young warrior
where did the kidnapper hide
I will give you your shield and Toskar
accept shield blaze vengeance
but suddenly the heroism of heat disappears
that he ripens with sweet admiration
not in strength to sigh in passion
suddenly glow with new delight
lily bare breast
under a menacing breathing cover
Are you the hero who cries out?
and the hand trembled tremulously
with the head take off the helmet shiny
and prick to see before you
in the distance you can see a secluded cliff
the cave in it dug deep
darken entrance bush surround
nearby the waves are making noise and foaming
evening when the moon is foggy

in the darkness of the night you delight in bliss
but you find yourself bold in Valhalla
he raises his sword and trembles with evleg
fall on the turf like a tuft of flying snow
blizzard torn away from the rock
rivals strive against each other
bloody current run on stone
to roll into the bushes in despair
the last voice of the evlegs to call
and death cold their rage fetter
on the gravestone into the midnight fog
step tremblingly tired leg
by lora the traveler goes in vain languid eye
seek a peaceful night's lodging in the thick darkness
cave no before he on the shore gloomy
not see hut heritage fisherman
in give dense forest swing wind with noise
the moon behind the cloud and the sea sleeps at dawn
go and wet moss grows on the rocks
ripen bard old fun last year
bending his gray brow over the howling stream
in the silence of time he contemplates the flight
jagged sword hanging on a branch gloomy willow
thoughtful singer turn his quiet gaze
the son of a foreign country and a fearful traveler
shuddered in horror and rushed past
stand traveler stand broadcast singer century past
here the brave fall almost their battle ashes
almost heroism child grave sleep fall asleep
alien head droop and seem to be on the hill
rise row shadow head bloody
with a smile proud to the wanderer to incline
whose coffin I see there to broadcast foreign
and the bard points his staff to the shore
quiver and steel helmet to nail to the cliff
cast a dim ray moon become golden
alas here is the mouth of the osgar river the elder inspired
oh early young man the last hour comes
but he search he I see as in a military formation
he is the first arrow with joy to expect
and break out of the row and fall into the boiling battle
Rest in peace, young man, you fell in glorious battle
in the color of the tender year to love osgar malvin
More than once he is happy to meet with his girlfriend
evening light moon sliding on the valley
and the shadow fell from the seaside menacing cliff
it seems their hearts are on fire for each other
one one osgar malvina breathe
but quickly the day of love and happiness fly by
and evening sorrow for the young man comes
once upon a dark night winter time sad
osgar knocking on the door beautiful young lady
and whisper young friend do not hesitate here your dear
but quietly in the hut again a timid hand
knock and listen only to the wind blowing with a whistle
Can I really sleep now, Malvina, there's darkness all around
snow falls hair freezes in fog
hear hear I am Malvina dear friend
he knocked for the third time with a creaking sound the door wobbled
he enters with trembling miserable what to see
darken his gaze malvina shudder
he to ripen in an embrace a traitor to move
and wild rage boils in your eyes
go numb and tremble young lover
he draws a formidable sword and no longer moves
and his pale spirit will hide in the darkness of the night
malvina hugging unfortunate knee
but to turn away the gaze to live to broadcast Oscar
I'm not your despicable one anymore, I'm a betrayal
forget to put out the wrong passion heat
and he quietly walks out the door in silence
fetter gloomy silent melancholy
disappear sweet forever charm
he is alone in the world, his soul is no longer dear
I see the young man hanging his head
Malvina name he whispered in despair
as the twilight slumbers over the sea abyss
on the heart lies sorrowful despondency darkness
he glanced at his friend's child year in a hurry
already motionless gaze does not recognize each other
from the feast to remove into the desert silent
he feeds his loneliness and sadness
and spend a long year of osgar among torment
suddenly the trumpet sounded Oden's son black eye
lead the formidable sword into a bloody battle
osgar hear the news and the battle flares up
here his sword will flash and death will run before him
cover wound here mouth on chest body
he mouth still hand sword around to search
and a deep sleep will fly away from the strong
run back enemy and quiet world hero
and everything is quiet around the burial mound
Only in autumn is there a cold, monthless time
when the top of the mountain weighs down the damp darkness
in a crimson cloud covered fog
a sad shadow sits over the gravestone
and the arrow rattle knock armor with quiver
and the maple tree will stir and make a mysterious noise
young daphnis chasing doris
stand scream lovely stand
say love and run for you
I swear I won't become one in that cyprida
keep quiet keep silent reason speak
and rogue Eros say you are my dear heart
you heart dear shepherdess repeat
and their heart fire love ignites
and mouth to foot the beautiful Daphnis
and dorid's passionate gaze lowered
run run reason she repeat
and the rogue Eros remains to speak

you want a priceless friend
so that I am a young poet
talk to you
and with the lyre forgotten
dream winged
leave the monastery
and the edge is secluded
where is the continuous world
to descend into darkness
and in the deep desert
reign silently
with a gloomy silence
and a fast arrow
I'll rush to the Nevsky bank
I'll hug my friend
my golden spring
and as a singer Lyudmila
dream slave dear
ascended under the father's roof
you don't carry gold
I am a poor monk
as a gift fart poem
secretly ascended to the sofa
at least a pen can help
oh how are you catching up
dear sister
what to occupy the heart with
evening time
jean-jacques li read
Janlis is in front of you
or with frisky hamilton
laugh with all my soul
or with heat and thomson
you are carried away by a dream
in the field where there is an oak grove
a breeze blows into the valley
and the curly forest whispers
and rush majestically
from the top of the mountain stream
or the little dog has grown old
in the pillow turned gray
wrap in a long shawl
and cherish with tenderness
you k she call morpheus
or look into the dark distance
thoughtful Svetlana
over the noisy Neva
or a sonorous piano
under the fugitive hand
mozart revive
or repeat the tone
piccini and rameau
but here I am with you
and to the joy of the silent
your friend blossom soul
like a clear spring day
forget the day of separation
day of sorrow and boredom
disappear sadness shadow
but this is just a dream
alas to the monastery
at pale candle glow
one write to sister
all is quiet in the gloomy cell
door latch
silence is the enemy of fun
and boredom for hours
chair old unupholstered
and a shaky bed
vessel water pour
straw flute
that's all that's in front of me
I see awaken
fantasy you
I am the only one to reward
you are transferred
to the magical hippocrene
and in the cell I am blessed
what would happen to me
goddess without you
familiar with vanity
nice for me
to carry away into the distance fate
I suddenly found myself in a dead end
how summer on the shore
be a prisoner
to bury forever
and creak the gates
closed behind me
and the world is beauty
dress black haze
from then on it's time to look at the light
like a prisoner from a dungeon
to the bright shine of the morning star
the light of day is rising
cast a ray of light to gild
through a narrow window
but the heart is darkened
it's not a joy
or it's late
like a ray of light in the sky
cover blackness
darken into a cloud
to meet with despondency
I am a dark shadow
and see you off with a sigh
hide day
looking through the bars through tears
finger the beads
but time passes
and with a stone gate
mouth mouth shutter
and to the magnificent Petrograd
through the valley mountain
zealously rush
hurry to the housewarming party
leave the cell dark
field garden your
under the table there is a hood with a chain
and the defrocked one will fly in
into your embrace
Is it possible to plant Cupid instead of roses?
tulip proudly tilt
fragrant lily of the valley jasmine and lily
which you always love
and before that wear it every day
on your marble chest
Is it possible dear Climene
what a strange change in taste
you love to smell not the morning flower
and the grass is green
art transformed
into fluffy powder
let him be a gray-haired professor of Gottingen
on the old pulpit bent arc
to fix one's deep mind on Latinism
cough up crushed tobacco
shove into a long nose withered hand
let the young dragoon have a moustache
sit by the window in the morning
with the rest of the morning sleep
from the pipe to drive out a grayish meerschaum smoke
let the beauty be sixty years old
Grace is on vacation and love is retired
which holds all the charm on the stand
which without a wrinkle on the body there is no place
slander pray yawn
and with faithful tobacco forget sorrow
and you are lovely but if it's tobacco
I like you so much, oh my imagination
ah if to turn into dust
and in the snuffbox in captivity
I can fall into your gentle finger
then I would be in heartfelt admiration
fall apart on the chest under a silk scarf
and even be able to be but that dream is empty
there is no way it can be
fate envious evil
oh why am i not tobacco
arist we promise tragedy such
that everyone burst into tears out of pity in the theater
that the tear of the viewer the river will flow
we are waiting for the golden drama
and what to wait and nothing to say
dignity it is impossible to reduce weight
Well, the right to succeed is to write
a pathetic piece
it's midnight time
through fog and darkness
drive quietly over the river
dashing Cossack
black hat on bekren
the whole zhupan is in dust
gun to the knee
saber to the ground
a faithful horse does not feel the bridle
step to perform
mane long worry
go deeper into the distance
there are two or three huts in front of him
break down the fence
here is the road to the village
there in the dense forest
don't find the girl in the forest
think grab denis
already a beauty in the bright room
clean up for the night
move the bottom of the bridle
pin the spur
and the horse arrow will rush
to wrap up the hut
into the cloud the moon silver
distant sky
sitting sadly under the window
beautiful girl
brave see red maiden
the heart beats silently
the horse quietly to the left to the left
right under the window
the night is getting dark
the moon disappeared
come out soon
water the horse
no to the young man
it's scary to approach
I'm afraid to leave the house
horse give water
oh, the girl is probably red
make friends with my sweetheart
night beauty dangerous
joy is not to be afraid
believe darling empty
false fear of discarding
spend golden time
cute, I bet
mount a greyhound with you
to go to a distant land
be happy with me
With friends everywhere is paradise
what is the girl bowing down to
conquer fear
timidly go to agree
happy to become a Cossack
jump fly
buddy friend love
she will be faithful for two weeks
to change in the third
let him not know Apollo
poet court philosopher
nobleman with a bow
to offer an ode in two hundred stanzas
but I am a dear Gorchakov
don't wake up with a rooster
and pompous verse
set of thunderous words
I can't sing empty
high, subtle and cunning
and don't dare turn it into a lira
my goose feather
no no dear prince not oda
you intend to dedicate
what to come to stick in the water
don't ask for a ford first
and in the wake of Derzhavin soar
I write my warehouse now
some kind of poem for a name day
what should i say at this hour
wish from a pure heart friend
How deep is your old age, dear prince?
child dear spouse
or wealth loud day
cross diamond star honor
Wouldn't it be nice to wish for glory
you are drawn to be on a bloody path
to shine in laurels and a crown
to throw thunder from your hands in battle
and may the victory be yours
like the ancient Nevsky hero
always fly after everywhere
not a poet of lust
such a song to congratulate
he is a good muse to leave forever
may God give you love for your life
pet gentle epicure
spend between bacchus and cupid
and there when the Stygian shore
flicker into the misty distance
God grant that in passionate rapture
you with languid sweetness in your eye
from the hand of young cupid
enter the dark cholna charon
fall asleep ruff on the chest
who will win in a minute
cold mind love
burden oppressive shackles
she doesn't put it on the wing
let there be no laughter, no frolic
with strict wisdom to be friends
but to argue with reason again
I'm not happy but I'm opening the door
like a mischievous Eros
knock at the gate
I test myself
this is the truth of this right word
good way to forgive love
for the blind goddess
not for chloe to fly
happiness happiness to grasp
I think I'm crazy in my pride
suddenly hear loud laughter
look back and eros
knock at the gate
No, I don't think I have to
to live in discord with this god
and for now life is a thread
old park is hiding there
let me rule him
having fun is my law
death open coffin terrible
darken the clear gaze
and not bump into Eros
the graveyard is already at the gate
in the grove gloomy shady
where the fragrant grass murmurs
bright wandering brook
night on a simple flute
sing the shepherd in love
languid hum, sad trill
repeat in the wilderness valley
suddenly from the depths of a cave
bacchus and venus worshiper
frisky faun lord
run out hermiy son
rose horn twine
ivy on black hair
goat fur wine pour
on the satyr's shoulder
god forest in arc bow
over bend crutch
hide behind a bush
listen to the night song
head swing in tune
the day passed in joy
sing in melancholy shepherd young
why did the dream come true
you disappear like a shadow from the eyes
and be covered in eternal darkness
ah when in the darkness of the night
under the mysterious moon
in the dark shadow of a cool grove
sweet sleep in silence
slowly hand to hand
with gentle chloe come
who can compare with me
chloe be then i'm cute
and now I am life a grave
white light soul get cold
sad forest sad stream
chloe friend cheat
I'm not cute anymore
sound disappear flute quiet
the singer falls silent and silence
reign in the wild grove
the only sound you can hear is the splashing of the waves
and sway the dodder
quietly-blow the marshmallow
leave the tree a thick canopy
suddenly satire appears
friendship cup circular
foamy silver wine
river with a grinning face
you are sad, your heart is gloomy
look how clear the juice is
shine light up moon
drink cup and soul
be just as clean and clear
I believe I moan in vain in trouble
good good fun
in grief to be friends with Bacchus
and the shepherd took the cup in his hand
soon drink it all to the bottom
about the power of wine
suddenly hide sorrow torment
the darkness of the soul will disappear in an instant
just bring a vial to your lips
everything will change instantly
all nature comes to life
happy young man in a dream
drink cup golden
he pours another
drink already the third but in the eye
the view of the surrounding area will darken
and the unfortunate one gets tired
languish head bow
teach satyr i
the shepherd says with a sigh
how to fight rock
how can i be happy
I can't drink forever
listen, dear young man
here you have useful advice
catch a moment of bliss forever
remember friendship instruction
Without wine there is no fun here
there is no happiness without love
Well, now I'll go and have a hangover
make peace with cupid
forget his offense
and into the embrace of Dorid
enjoy happiness again
here is my mirror take it cyprida
goddess beauty beautiful be forever
gray time is not scary she is an insult
she is not a mortal person
but I submit to fate
it is not in the power to see oneself in the transparency of glass
not the one I am
neither the one that is now
wither wither summer red
fly away clear day
a stormy fog is creeping in
night in the shadow doze
empty the grain field
cool playful stream
forest curly gray
the vault of heaven will turn pale
Svet-Natasha where are you now
that no one will see you
or not want a single hour
to share a heart with a friend
nor above the lake wavy
not under the shelter of the fragrant linden
early late time
I won't meet you
soon soon winter cold
grove field visit
a light in a smoky shack
soon to shine brightly
I can't see how lovely I am
and like a siskin in a tight cage
be at home to grieve
and Natasha remembers
friend, it's time for leisure
everything is quiet everything is at peace
soon a tablecloth and a glass
here comes the golden wine
fizz champagne into a glass
Friend, what about Canton?

but respect modesty
move the foamy glass closer
to bless for battle
comrade dear friend direct
shake hand hand

This is not the first time we drink together
and often swear
but the cup of friendship is poured
and immediately make peace
and you who are from a child's year
one joy you breathe

Isn't it good to have a family history?
in honor of the Bacchus village
now you string squeak
upset violin

with chatterbox country hellenic
and don't dare to hoarse your voice
with chapel and with rhyme
sing the hero of the north
incomparable virgil
I read and reread
don't try to imitate him
in tender feeling and harmony
I'm a German, I'm taking apart a klopstock
and not be able to understand the wise
I don't want to sing like him
I want to understand
everything from small to large
for Milton and Camoes
I'm afraid to soar without wings
don't dare to write meaningless verse

do not reject this opportunity
if you introduce yourself
I swear to tell the girl
disappear in an instant ghost
fly out of the window quickly
sigh quietly zoyinka

and calm down in bed
soon soon the dream was forgotten

discordant choir repeat
poet in your subject will
boldly strike into the sonorous string
with Zhukovsky sing bloody battle
and death threatens the battlefield
and you are in line to meet her
and you will comprehend fate

barely mow without withering
or inspired juvenal
arm yourself satire sting
sometimes take her whistle
strike ridicule vice

and is it possible for us to fix it?
but leave Tredyakovsky
to destroy peace so often

when to go to the housewarming party
to fall asleep is everyone's destiny
say give god he is joy
he at least knows how to love in life
hang a gloomy shroud of night
on the vault of the sky doze
in the silent silence rest the valley and grove
into the gray fog of the distant forest
a stream can barely be heard running into the shade of an oak grove
the wind barely breathes fall asleep on a leaf
and the quiet moon is like a majestic swan
float into the silver cloud
float and pale ray
illuminate the object around
ancient linden alley opens before the eye
look through both the hill and the meadow
here you can see the young willow intertwined with the poplar
and the water was reflected in the crystal
the queen among the field flows proudly
in luxurious beauty bloom
from the hill flint waterfall
flow beaded river
There's a naiad splashing around in a quiet lake
his lazy wave
and there in the silence is a huge palace
lean on the vault rush to the cloud
Isn't it here that the earthly god spent his peaceful day?
Isn't it the Russian temple of Minerva?
Isn't it midnight elysium?
beautiful royal-rural garden
where lion fight rest eagle russia powerful
peace and joy in the bosom
Alas, that golden time has passed
when under the great scepter the wife

memory of the previous year
look around with a sigh ross broadcast
disappear all great no
and in the thought to deepen over the fertile bank
sit in silence bow the wind to the ear
the summer that passed flickered before the eye
and in a quiet spirit of admiration

above the hard mossy rock
rise monument widen wing
above him sits a young eagle
and a heavy chain and a thunderbolt
around the formidable pillar to wrap three times
all around the foothills the grey shaft rustles
lie down in the shiny foam
in the shadow of a thick, gloomy pine tree
a simple monument is being erected
oh how much is he for you Kagul bank diarrhea
and the glorious homeland of the drag

trained for battle amidst the battlefield

and the idle plow rusts in the field
go they force no obstacle
destroy everything, turn everything into dust
and the shadow of the pale dead Chad Bellon
in the air unite the shelf
to descend into the dark grave incessantly
or wander through the forest in the silence of the night
but the click is heard to go to give foggy
sound of chain mail and sword
fear the foreign army
Russia move son
rise up and both old and young fly to the daring
their hearts to take revenge

and behold, the battle blazed on the hill, thunder rumbled
in thicken the air with sword arrow whistle
and splash blood on the shield

but the heavenly Almighty is strong in battle

the shore and the bright grove will no longer shine in the fire
everything is dead everything is silent

but what I see is a hero with a smile of reconciliation
dirty with golden olive
the thunder of war still rumbles in the distance

and he brings the enemy not death but salvation
and the beneficial world of the earth

and curly head
I love light and its noise

I am disgusted by quarrels and bickering
and partly also teaching

and to be honest
I would say that I still love
if I weren't in high school

and a fast stream
in the stream carry a flower
invisible to the eye

live well
don't go to fashionable society
there is a carriage on the street
don't hear the annoying knock

creak on the pavement
or a traveler to my house
came to look for a place to stay for the night
road crutch
knock on the gate

last spring
young hla
to think of loving
like a breeze
early time
drive a leaf
with a frisky wave
so incessant
fickle
passion to play
lilu temir
adore everything
heart and lyre
dedicate everything
what's in vain
with chest beautiful
I'm tearing off my shawl
futile betrayal
image of Elena
to burn in the heart
ah come back
joy eye
cold touch
my sadness
to call in vain
poor singer
no, not to meet
flour end
so to the grave
sad, despondent
seek shelter
all forgotten
thorn twine
drag a chain
Licinia do you see the fast chariot
crown the laurel with brilliant purple
arrogant to fall apart vetuli young
in the crowd of people fly along the pavement
watch as everyone in front of him bends his back diligently
like a lictor of a regiment to drive away the unfortunate people
flatterer senator beauty long row
with humility he has a touching, vengeful look
wait in secret trepidation smile eye movement
as if a wonderful god was blessing
and a small child and an old man with gray hair
strive for everything he and his gaze and soul
and even the trace of the wheel imprints in the mud
like some kind of monument they seem sacred
O Romulan people before whom you fall into the dust
before whom to feel in the soul such a base fear
Quirite proudly bows down under the yoke
who is to be enslaved by heaven
should I say, my homeland, Vetulia, shame on me
depraved youth sit in council husband
favorite despot senate weak rule
to spread the yoke over Rome to dishonor the fatherland
vetulius roman king o shame o time
or the universe is devoted to destruction
but who under the portico with his hand behind his back
in a torn cloak and with a beggar's crutch
hang your head frown go
I'm a philosopher and I won't make mistakes
give where to say in clothes so wretched
through the magnificent Rome to wander your way
where I don't know myself desert I search
I don't want to live among debauchery anymore
iapetus child vice malice see
leave Rome forever I hate people
licinia good friend isn't it good and we
bow dream fortune vanity
gray-haired stoic example learn
Isn't it good to say goodbye to the city soon?
where everything is at the mercy of the law, rightness
and wife and husband and honor and beauty
Let the glycerine beauty be young
equally all is common as a circular cup
another inexperienced in love to catch the net
we are ashamed to have weakness with wrinkles
fly from old man love into crowd fun
let the shameless Clitus nobleman slave Cornelius
leave the bed sleep with the cock crow
from noble to rich to run from house to house
I am a Roman heart boiling in my chest freedom
I do not sleep, the spirit of the great people
licinia hurry away from care
crazy proud deceptive beauty
the tiresome rhetorician Herostratus of Parnassus
to the village to transfer the paternal penates
into a shady grove on the seashore
It is not difficult to find a beautiful bright house
where there is no longer any fear of popular unrest
in old age to rest in silence and solitude
and settle down in a cozy corner there
when the fiery oak is raised into the fireplace
remember the old man for his grandfather's filament
to ignite your spirit with petron juvenal
in thunder satire vice to depict
and this century's character is to expose posterity
o Rome o proud land debauchery crime
come terrible day day revenge punishment
to foresee the terrible greatness of the end
fall fall into dust universe crown
people wild son fierce battle
war terrible sword to take in bloody hand
and to leave both the mountain and the sea for oneself
and gush on you boil river
disappear rome he cover deep darkness
and the traveler turns his eye to the pile of stones
speaks to think in deep dreaming
freedom of Rome will grow and slavery will be destroyed
in the cave helicon
I have no time to give birth
in the name of Apollo
Tibullus baptize
and light hippocrene
to get drunk from childhood
under the shelter of the spring rose
poet i grow
the cheerful son of hermiy
child to love
in a day of golden playfulness
I'm a pipe to give
It's too early to meet her
I hum incessantly
It's not hard to play at least
but the muse does not get bored
and you are a singer fun
and the Permessian friend the maiden
you want glory
path to fly
say goodbye to anacreon
I'm in a hurry for the maroons
and sing to the sound of the lyre
war bloody feast
I give little phoebe
hunting is a meager gift
sing under a foreign sky
far away home lara
and with the daring Icarus
It's not for nothing that you're afraid to fly
delirium your way
let everyone be in their own way
the evening dawn in the abyss burns out
Silence hangs over the gloomy Elbe
through the clouds pale quietly run
foggy moon
already to the west gray to dress haze
with plain blue water merge sky
alone in the darkness of the night over a wild cliff
sit napoleon
the gloomy thought crowds into the mind of the destroyer
he is new in dream europe chain forge
and raise a sullen gaze to the distant shore
whisper fiercely
all around me everything is dead sleep to rest
lie down in fog abyss stormy wave
do not swim out even fragile into the sea
not a hungry beast shall howl over the grave
I am here alone, full of rebellious thoughts
o will the steering wheel soon foam up
I rush obedient wave
and sleep water interrupted silence
worry night over elbe rock
dark darken behind a cloud moon
there I wait, fearless squad
already converge already close in line
the world lies in chains before me
I pass to you through the black abyss
and the deadly storm will break out again
and a battle breaks out over the Gallic eagle
with sword in hand victory will fly
bloody current in the valley to boil
and I will thunder to cast the throne into dust
and crush Europe's wondrous shield
but all around me is a dead sleep to rest
lie down in fog abyss stormy wave
do not swim out even fragile into the sea
not a hungry beast shall howl over the grave
I am here alone, full of rebellious thoughts
oh happiness evil seducer
and you, like a sweet dream, hide from the eye
in the midst of the storm my secret keeper
and a faithful mentor from his youth
how long has the invisible path been
I will touch you to lead
and hide the daring hand
brow in a laurel crown
how long have people been trembling with awe
I timidly bear the tribute of freedom
It is an honor to bow the banner
smoke thunder all around me
and glory shines over the head
rush to cover my wing
but a menacing cloud hangs over Moscow
and the thunder of revenge will strike
midnight king young you move the militia
and death will follow the bloody banner
respond can fall
and peace on earth and joy in heaven
and I am a shame and imprisonment
and shatter my ringing shield
don't shine your helmet on the battlefield
in the coastal grain sword forget
and fade into the fog
and quietly everything circles into the silence of the night
In vain do I seem to see the howling of death
and knock the sword shines
and the fallen ardent lamentation
just splash wave listen greedy ear
shut up battle click familiar
feud bloody fade thunder
and the torch of vengeance will go out
but the hour is near, the fatal minute
the boat is already flying where the formidable throne is hidden
a thick fog spreads all around
and the gaze of death will sparkle
turn pale mutiny on deck sit
fear about gallium europe revenge revenge
cry your scourge rise and all fall into the dust
everything will bend and then into universal destruction
the king sits on the coffin
fall silent on the sky lie gloomy shadow
and the distant moon leaves the dark canopy like a cloud
tremble weak light to the west pour out
eastern star play ocean
and the boat was about to run into the fog
under the Elbe vault the formidable rock
and gallium you o predator overshadow
run with trembling legitimate king
but to ripen or to fade away the day instantly the darkness to hide
face glow dawn
the silence will spread over the gray abyss
darken sky vault thunderstorm in haze hang
all fall silent tremble destruction over you
and your lot is yet to be hidden
dear birthday boy
about Pushkin dear
wander to you hermit
with open shower
hug the alien
but a good singer
meet without fussing
with a front porch
he is a guest without etiquette
don't ask for hello

accept his kiss
and pure desire
heartfelt simplicity
arrange a feast for the guests
on a wax table
supply beer mug
and a punch cup
old drinking buddy

you are a happy dear friend
into the golden calm
let your carefree age flow
go day by day
and you are grace in conversation
not knowing black is trouble
live like horace
although not a poet
under poor shelter
you are not familiar at all
with the sinister hypocrates
with a frowning priest
not to see at the threshold
crowd care
find to you road
gaiety and eros
you love the sound of a glass
and the pipe has thick smoke
and the demon metroman
you do not rule
you are lucky in this lot
say what more
I wish a friend
have to shut up
God willing, I will be with my friend
to celebrate the hundredth of May
cover gray hair
say you verse
here's a cup to pour
joy to be till the grave
our faithful companion
and let us both die
when knocking the bowl is full
let the gloomy rhymer
entwine poppy and nettle
cold ode creator zealous
to weave nonsense in a boring way
call to dinner general
about galich faithful friend glass
and a fat morning feast
you are called a lazy sage
in the shelter poetry happy
under the distant blissful roof
long ago in my solitude
in a circle a bottle and a friend
don't ripen mug we are yours
girlfriend long pleasure
wit and laughter guest
you don't feel like working
mount the troika evil horse
leaving petropolis and care
fly to happy town
go to the yid zolotarev
in his common corner
we gathered there in a circle
spill wine stream of hooks
and with a bang the door was locked
ban fun young
and a proud pie on the table
friend to hamper row
shine bright knife
with you bravely to repel
and in a moment the wall is destroyed
when to weigh down the wine
to bend head to knee
want to relax in peace
and lower into the pillow
in order to sleep peacefully
drop pour mug
on an old velvet sofa
then the message is a couplet
ballad fable sonnet
leave our modest pocket
and a deep sleep the sloth be
but the glass's ringing will wake you up
you jump up with a cheerful head
leave a crumpled pillow
raise dear girlfriend
and in the cell again the feast is mountainous
about galich time irrevocable
and the terrible hour is close, close
when to hear the voice of glory
leaving the cell is a pleasant shelter
Tatar throw off your robe
forgive virgin muse
forgive shelter youth joy
put on tight leggings
curl a proud moustache into a ring
a pair of epaulettes will shine
and I am a pet important muse
in the number to fight cornet
about galich galich hurry
you call and sleep lazily
and a friend neither modest nor arrogant
and the cup is full to the brim
the moon is creeping across the sky
darkness on the hill graying
on the water mouth silence
from the valley the wind blows
keep silent singer spring day
in the desert dark grove
the herd rested in the middle of the field
and the quiet flight of midnight
and a peaceful corner of bliss
night twilight dress
the fire in the fireplace goes out
and the candle burns
stand god home face
in a poor ark
and the pale night light flickers
before clay penate
head on hand inclined
into deep oblivion
I'm immersed in sweet thoughts
alone on the bed
with magic night darkness
during the monthly radiance
fly off frisky crowd
winged dream
and a quiet, quiet voice flows
tremble the golden string
in the deep, silent darkness of the hour
sing young dreamer
fulfill mystery longing
silence inspired
fly frisky hand
on lira lively
Blessed is he who in his low hut
in prayer do not ask for happiness
he is Zeus's reliable guard
from a terrible storm
on poppy laziness in a quiet hour
he falls asleep sweetly
and the terrible voice of the war trumpet
he does not wake up
let it strike the resounding shield
and with a bold look
I am glory to threaten from afar
bloody finger
and the battle banner flutters
and blaze a bloody battle
lovely heart silence
no go no go for glory
I find a peaceful shelter in the wilderness
and lead the day humbly
give me lira from god
the poet is a priceless gift
and the muse is faithful with me
Praise you goddess
you are my red house
and the wild desert
on a weak morning golden day
singer you overshadow
wreath of young myrtle
cover his forehead
and the heavenly light will shine
fly into a modest cell
and breathe slightly, bowing down
over the baby cradle
oh, I'm your young companion
right up to the gates of the grave
I need to fly with a dream
spread your light wing
drive away gloomy sadness
captivate the mind deception
and my dear life is bright far away
say for fog
and my quiet be late hour
and death is a good genius
whisper at the door knock
time to enter the shadow dwelling
so on a winter evening a sweet dream
come into the peaceful canopy
crown the poppy and bow
on the staff of languid laziness
I want to die tomorrow
and into the magical world of pleasure
on the quiet shore water oblivion
cheerful shadow fly away
forgive forever the charm
joy life and love
come closer oh my friend
reverence and attention
the singer decides to die
so with the evening moon
Can't we put turf in the garden?
patterned white veil
on the dark shore sleepy water
where we conduct our conversation
Can't you make a long move?
carry fill cup
invite to the last feast
arrogant son of Semele
Eros our friend lyre
god and mortal ruler
let joy come running
wave a frisky rattle
and we laugh from the heart
for a full frothy mug
let the playful crowd
fly away our native muse
they are the first cup of the round robin
sacred friend we they bonds
to the early morning star
until the quiet ray of dawn
don't leave the poet's hand
phial brotherly succession
my last time
dream sweet singer
press to the delighted chest
to languish tenderly for the last time
not to remember eternity and friend
for the last time on the chest snow
revel in joy young day
When will the East become golden?
in the darkness the young morning star
and the white poplar will light up
cover with morning dew
serve bunches of anacreon
he is my teacher
and I will go the same way
to the sad shore of Acheron
forgive my dear friend
shake hands goodbye
and give give promise
when will I hide forever
my will to execute
come my dear singer
sing the praises of Bacchus and Temir
you give me laziness and lyre
yes be the muse above you
Don't forget our friendship
about pushchin windy sage
take with my deep cup
withered myrtle crown
friend you leave your heart
and the memory of the past red day
fetter happy laziness
on the bed there are poppies and lilies
my verse gives oblivion
last breath about friend she
for a quiet funeral celebration
I am obliged to invite you
cheerfulness friend solitude
the ticket will be distributed
flock frisky crowd
head in wreath hand with hand
and let the coffin where the singer is
disappear into the helicon grove
write your fluent cutter
here the wise young man slumbers
pet nega and apollo
Elvina dear friend come give me your hand
I wither stop heavy life sleep
say whether to see or not for a long time separation
I am doomed to condemn
Will we never look at each other again?
or will eternal darkness cover my day
Will we never see the morning again?
in an embrace of love
Elvina why at the dead of night
I can't hug you with joy
on the dear to strive full languor eye
and passion to tremble
and into mute joy into delight
listen to your sweet whisper and quiet moan
and quietly in the modest darkness for the bliss of awakening
close darling fall asleep
you are not the heiress of cleron
not for you your law
owner pind draw
you don't send many gods
your voice body movement
silent gaze appeal
no need to admit praise
and the noisy splash of surprise
cruel destined fate
you are an actress to be bad
but khloy you are my dear
you crowd after laughter
promise lover joy
so the crown is before you
and undoubted success
you are a captive spectator of the news
when you sing out of time
stand motionless in front of us
eat and often not in the right way
and we are a diligent hand
everyone clap loudly shout
whistle satirist shut up
and all the lovely ones will submit
when in awkwardness your
you put your hand on your chest
or raise them again
to put on the chest to be ashamed
when milona is young
babbling something is not for us
to assure in love without feeling
or without memory in tears
cold emit ah
fall calmly into the chairs
blush and breathe a little
everyone whispers oh how good
alas, another would boo
big deal beauty
oh wise man to lie
not everything in the world is vanity
captivate the same beauty
a hundred times blessed lover that
who is tenderly before you
dare to sing about love
in verse and prose on stage
you swear to adore
who are you to answer
don't dare speak of treason
Blessed is he who can forget his role
on stage with a cute actress
shake hand she hope to be
still blessed behind the scenes
Do you remember my brother by the cup?
as in a pleasant silence
we drown our sorrows
into clear, foamy wine
how to hide silently
to our dark corner
lazily bask with bacchus
school guard in the distance
remember friend whisper
punch glass around
glass menacing silence
flame pipe groshev
boil about how wonderful
current smoky leak
suddenly a pedantic voice is terrible
we can be heard in the distance
and the bottle breaks in an instant
and the glass is all out the window
spill all over the floor
punch and light wine
run away in a hurry
momentary fear disappears in an instant
cheek rosy color playful
mind and heart on lips
laughter pure joy
fixed dull gaze
change hour hangover
sweet bacchus conspiracy
oh my dear friend
you swear to the table
every year in a carefree hour
remember his wine
where are you my sloth
lover pleasure
is it really solitude?
you are not my dear peace
Am I really with you?
only help paper
minute to see off
and is no longer visible
Parnassian tramp
my neighbor is on the pin
and you hide from the muse
minute homebody
to say goodbye to the penates
already a dark corner
and the garden will be empty
where are we in the evening
make noise over a glass
where who we treat
trout pie
and a foamy glass
we serve bacchus
run for a day day
without a friendly meeting
merry feasting
cheerful son
to separate from you
and noisy conversation
and a long lunch
not so lively
alone in a cramped closet
evening silence
want wise man kind
talk to you
already the dark night embraces
the shore is calm water
purr in the cell doze
arrogant old cat
so far the dream is lovely
under the canopy of a quiet wing
to the unknown monastery
I don't put to sleep
Morpheus in Waiting
I'm lying in bed
and a quick message
without strict diligence
traitor write
far away is that village
where is phoebe's sister
I spend my leisure time with negativity
say among the capital
what are you doing my friend
is it really a poet's shelter?
now in the midst of the whirlwind there is light
in the distance, the native field
and neighbor and friend
Are we really going to the noisy theatre?
where is the hefty Apollo
half-witted partner
glorify deafen
tortured chant
meaningless verse
you sleep under a terrible roar
actor and bow
or a court sage
with a fake smile
pre color tape
hang your head
with a blind turntable
to get acquainted to wish
or Croesus to the table
in a custom verse
it is cowardly to call
No, my good Galich
bow you are not related
friend wisdom direct
truthful and noble
he loves silence
fate is obedient
to the master's treasury
look indifferently
ruble tax farmer
laugh happy hour
do not remove the cap
philosopher before midas
let him not be friendly
with fortune treacherous
but bacchus reward
grateful philosopher
when this god is young
evening time
Lafite and amber grog
with a smile on his lips
he brings it to the glass
and ask for a drop to drink
swing on the leg
dreaming of hugging
love his lead
and young friendship
he is weaving a wreath
and he is happy to admit
it's not a dream come true
when the minute rushes
fun on the wing
when a friend is a poet
from morning till night with him
make noise sing a verse
drink mosel warm up
my friend
message to read
and light the pipe
rhymeless dashing
leave the boring city
to unite with each other
and with them inseparable
to get along in the desert
run run capital
oh my galich come here
here is the pink morning glory
never see
lazy under the blanket
with the sage of Tibur
we often have a glass
wake up and fall asleep
watch you in reward
our delvig our poet
carry your ballad
and stans grapes
and to lily couplet
and becomes full
your small cramped house
here's a cute wit
our singer is dragging himself along
up the stairs with a horn
and everyone will come to you
and again every day
verse prose becomes
we drive away the shadow of sadness
young friend
we will be visiting
we are life golden day
it's not scary to waste
share with zabava
we are the rest of the century
with the sorceress-glory
and with the young bacchus
the last radiance behind the forest grief
evening quietly fade dawn
silent valley deaf
a river swirls in the desert fog
lazy ridge go cloud
between them is the golden moon
cast iron armor on the hill to lie
spear crushed in glove damask
and the shield under the helmet is rusty
the spur dug into the moistened moss
lie still and moon horn
above they are in the bloody shine
around the hill go around each other strong horse
the proud eye will dim the fire
he bows his head in abusive language
careless hoof beat stone valley
and look at the armored horse, the faithful one
and tremble and moan wildly
into the darkness get lost alien go
with hope he carries timidity in his heart
leaning over a walking stick
he climbed the hill and into the dim distance
he look and go and ringing steel
push tired leg
cool alien chainmail sound
to perish menacingly in they bone to knock
roll on the stones with a helmet
hide in a dumb skull at a dull sound
neigh horse spirited gallop in summer up the hill
look and head bow
the traveler is already far away in the darkness wandering at night
it seems like a bone is crunching under my feet
but the morning dawns
fight in battle lie on the hill
and the armor is motionless and the helmet does not knock
and the horse will go around dying
listen to the innocent muse
sly confessor
resident field deserted
poet sinful face
multiply myself
and I'm the head of the drooping
before dear dream
my uncle the poet
That's why I give advice
and to make matchmaking with the muse
First I'm naughty
joke verse cut
and there they will print
and now I'm a brother
empty fool
this one this other one
Yes, I am guilty
thanks for the message
but what good am I in that
on the sinner later
because it becomes a laughing stock
point the finger
traitor with apollo
you are obviously at the same time
and I am known as a pradon
from now on it's destined
trouble is found everywhere
Alas, I'm a metromaniac
where can I hide
traitor-friend
innocent creation
send secretly into the city
and the fruit is solitude
embossing to convey
paper kill
poet surround
with a smile witty
ah sir i say
you write a poem
can't they be seen?
you in they portray
of course a stream
of course cornflower
or a quiet breeze
and the grove and the flower
about delvig draw
I am a muse, my destiny
but are you my sorrow
want to multiply
into the arms of morpheus
carefree spirit to cherish
at least one more year
let me be lazy
and enjoy the bliss
I am truly a nega son
but at least there is no hunting there
but it's already a concern to come
from all sides
and be forced
fight with the magazine
to bargain with the newspaper
with the count to admire
pardon apollo
where is our rose
my friend
wither the rose
child of dawn
don't talk
here is life youth
do not repeat
so joy fades
in the soul to say
forgive regret
and on the lily
we indicate
to subside the battle tribe to the distant limit
inaudible battle noise and voice trumpet military
with heavenly height at the sound of the slender lyre
A bright world will descend upon the dark earth
to happen Russian tsar to achieve you glorious goal
In vain the arrogant one flies to his homeland
in vain to advance the banner of the countless squad
to be able to crown a giant with audacity
to go to death menacingly dragging a chain behind oneself
the fiery sword will flash for smoky Moscow
the star destroyer fades into eternal darkness
and the fiery crown will fade on the brow
shuddered happiness son and throw fate
he is the Russian land, he cannot see under himself
run and revenge thunder fly he after
and from the proud throne fell and again to rise and not
you are our brave king praise thanksgiving
when the enemy regiment covers the distance
in armor, having taken up arms, put on a feathered helmet
to kneel before the highest altar
you draw your sword and swear a holy oath
to protect one's native land from the yoke
we heed this oath and proud heart
father fly after him in fiery delight
and fatal death to burn and tremble
and the Russians before the enemy a formidable stronghold of steel
to the sword a cry will be heard and a whirlwind will rush
banners rustle in the wind to develop
hug brother brother and darling give hand
young warrior on sad separation
fight flare up freedom fierce fight
and death they grab cold hand
and I am in the distance, thunder in your reliable canopy
I quietly blossom carefree serene
alas I cannot judge the mysterious limit
fight for you under the enemy hail arrow
son of borodin o kulmsky hero
I see how your formation flies to battle
soul enthusiastic for brother hurry
why shouldn't I shed blood for the battlefield?
why squeeze the sword baby hand
cover the wound do not fall I before you
and glory will not rest under your wing in the morning
why is it a great thing to be a witness
oh how majestic immortal you are
when to rush to the strong with the son
and raise the forehead from the gloom of the coffin
people fallen under the burden of shackles
heavy chains shake with delight
and with timid joy to ask each other
Are we really free or have we fallen into the terrible trap?
who is brave who will rise up in thunder to the north
and the old head of Europe to bow
king savior knee to surround
free hand from slave bondage
and the rebellious power will disappear before you
and now you, our son, return to our king
and the edge of midnight is illuminated by delight
to cast a full glance of humility upon one's people
the whole face shines with joy and love
listen everywhere the good news is carried
everywhere a proud cry of joy is heard
along the streets noise everywhere shine celebration
and you among the crowd Russia is a deity
meet leader victory fly your squad
old man happy age forget ekaterina
look at you with silent tears
you our Russian tsar leave the steel helmet
and the formidable sword of war and the shield of our fence
pour out before Janus the sacred world cup
and the hand can crush the battle
universe autumn desired silence
and the time will come for golden peace
cover helmet rust and arrow hardened
in a hidden quiver to forget your flight
happy peasant not to know stormy trouble
to the field to pull the plow the world of sophistication
ship flying trade winged
feed cut through the free ocean
and the young son of a warlike Slav
calm idleness with annoyance indulge
and there is no time to gather around the old man in silence
to bow the greedy ear and the old crutch
and the camp and the military formation and the distant pine forest with the hills
he slowly drew on the ashes before them
word truth free simple
they glory to the past year in the story to revive
and the good king blesses with tears
so i am happy to be so i enjoy
joy quiet delight to revel in
and where is the fun fast day
rush through the summer dream
fade charm pleasure
and again around me there is a gloomy shadow of boredom
yesterday for the punch bowl
I'm sitting with the hussars
and silently with a gloomy soul
look at the distant path
say what to look at on the road
my brave question
still she you thank God
friend not to spend
lower your head to your chest
I'll whisper soon
hussar no longer she is with me
sigh and keep silent
a tear hangs on an eyelash
and sink into the glass
child you cry about the girl
he was ashamed to scream
leaving hussar oh my heart hurts
you know not to grieve
alas one tear is enough
to poison the glass

You are eight years old and I am seventeen

but is that really how to save?
for myself for a friend
or for chloe young
I need to have mercy, take pity,

don't think my censor is gloomy
that I rage all night
fetter the poetic thought
peace sacrifice verse
what to run around the whole corner
ruffle a clump of hair
like the priest of Phoebus
flash a menacing eye
barely breathe frown
and light your lamp
sit down at a shaky table and groan
sit sit three nights in a row
and sit out the trashy nonsense
so write and say not as a reproach

poem scribble hunt find
for glory, friendship or eros
I will immediately finish my work
sit with a good friend
should I lie in a downy bed
wander over the quiet water
in the oak grove it is dark and deaf
think about waving hand
to suddenly start talking in rhyme
and no one is the sea anymore
my lively verse
but if ever
wish to rest in bliss
sit in front of the fireplace
one free gentleman
catch my previous thought
that's not for the name of the poet
scribble two or three verses
and sing them in a low voice
but should I know about my persecutor
how do i talk to you
carefree pind visitor
I am young and basking with the muse
the morning was already shining brightly
to illuminate the field and grove
the cock has long since crowed
half-doze and yawn
chapel in song to call
write a short poem
among pleasant oblivion
leaning head on pillow
and in simplicity without decoration
my apology
a little sleepy hand
under the shade of laziness unknown
so blissful singer charming
when to sing faith-faith
or draw with a smile
into a relaxed rapture
secluded attic
in such a lazy position
the verse flows this way and that
is it possible in your creation
calm down the cheerful thought noise
then put a cold mind

Welcome poet

but the light will not change into anything
everything goes the same way

but I am with Parnassian enthusiasm
I'd like to hang myself right now
that I am good, I swear by it
write and sing in every way
praise my genius in the newspaper
in aspasia to idolize
and I'm still the last one in the poet
I scold both old and young

O notorious mute

Lucifer comes from the abyss
humble but brow-beating
Napoleon Napoleon

and the meek white-fleeced lamb
to excel like a wild gog
fall like the spirit of sataniel
disappear demonic power
blessed is our Lord God
oh my mocker exclaims
what a good thing this kind of verse is
I wouldn't be able to penetrate into their meaning myself
the late Mr. Bobrov
what will happen to you Derzhavin
and you are fate neutone equal
you are god you are a worm you are light you are night
go mercury heart hurts
I go crazy I can't help but
and in a moment he flies away
what a wonderful phenomenon
von-vizin satellite say
leave empty surprise
Hermione answered with a grin
on pinda glorious lomonosov
with annoyance there is no time to see
that the sonorous lyre in the host of Russia
Tatar shaved thunder
and the wrath of Pindar Kholmogory
and secret envy burns
but Phoebus heard the voice of reproach
he wants to calm down
and stumble my Derzhavin
apocalypse to propose
Denis he will always be glorious
but ah why live so long
it's time to go home, Hermia
terrible rhymer dead man
leave russia quickly
wandering tired I finally
but suddenly a mill nearby began to knock
in the middle of the grove, dark and dense
the river is making noise on the shore
the hut is simple
to the gate narrow road
an ancient maple tree leans into the window
and falconette cupid
threaten with a grin at the threshold
Of course the singer lives here
say rejoice dead man
to rise to rise and what to see
in a pleasant bliss on the bed
singer penates young
with crown rose head
barely cover the blanket
with lovely lila dozing
and brown the phial
whisper sweetly into oblivion
von-vizin watch amazed
familiar look but who is he
Isn't this guy incomparable?
or Kleist or Anacreon himself
he cost they say mercury
erat grace cupid
crown his myrtle
and Phoebus Zlata
honor your favorite
but I'm too lazy to tie the reins
he only drinks, laughs, sleeps
and to bask in the youth with lila
completely forget that he drinks
so I'll wake up the rake
tell von vizin to get angry
and in an instant pull back the curtain
singer hear the prophetic voice
It's annoying to wake up covered in fluff
lazy hand out
force yourself to look into the light
then turn to the side
and fall into a deep sleep again
what should our hero do
hang your head go to rest
and only grumble to myself
I hear as if with annoyance
he scolds the Russian without mercy
and here's what I would like to say
when the tail starts working
and may Father sleep peacefully
our genius will not rise for a long time
and things won't go well
all in a mysterious silence
hill dress darkness
walk in the cloudy glow
young crescent moon
dark myrtle curtain
leaned towards the water
in they are the entrance to the forest
whose tomb to see there
rose young scarlet
ancient stone all around
and they don't dare to eat marshmallows
flutter a trembling wing
see lyre over grave
doze in sweet silence
only time the mournful ringing
like laziness sweet voice
in the dead one can hear a string
see turtledove on lyre
in the rose cup and crown
each other into eternal peace
here the theosan sage sleeps
look at the tomb
son is a joy to portray
here on the windy twig
our frisky Anacreon
beauty enchanted
She sings a tender hymn
crown grapes
his juice flows into the cup
here he is looking in the mirror
I say I am grey and old
life is to be given and enjoyed
life, alas, is not an eternal gift
here you can throw your hand on the lira
and it is important to frown
want to sing he is god of war
but to sing one love
nature is getting ready here
he has a heavy debt to pay
old man dance in a circle
thirst to ask to quench
around the gray-haired philosopher
maiden dance and sing
he is stingy with time
steal a few minutes
here is the muse and the charita
take your favorite to the grave
ivy rose twine
game laughter follow leave
he disappears like pleasure
like an indistinct sigh love
your mortal age is a dream
happiness is frisky to catch
enjoy enjoy
often pour a cup
passion tender get tired
and for the cup to rest
you want to know my dear friend
my dream desire goal
and the quiet voice of a simple flute
with a smile friendship listen
but can the poet be playful
slave dream young
in the picture fast and lively
depict the world in order
all that in golden youth
Imagination I say
now when there is laziness in peace
I hide in the deserted shadow
your chain feeling knit
and my age is quiet as a clear day
empty nega decoration
don't see in my hut
look with a smile regret
the poor rich man on the splendor
and happy with himself
not thirst mountain silver
not to know tomorrow or yesterday
contented modest fate
and think about what the singer is
diamond yahont topaz
porphyry empty vase
dear doll at the corner
what are they cloths albion
and a lush lyon cover
on a fashionable chair and table
and a shawl bed in the bedroom
Isn't it nice in a distant village?
or to a humble town
in the distance the capital, care and thunder
take refuge in a peaceful corner
with which luxury is unfamiliar
where can you relax on holiday
oh if only someday
poet dream come true
Is solitude really a joy?
he is not destined to taste
I see my village
my zakharovo it is
with a fence in the river wavy
with a bridge and a shady grove
mirror water reflect
My house with a balcony is on the hill
be able to go to the fun garden
where flora and pomona are together
I give a flower with fruit
where is the old maple dark row
rise to the sky
and the poplar rustles dully
there is a dawn to hurry
with a humble spade in hand
the path winds into the meadow
tulip and rose watering
and happy in the morning work
here, bend under the oak tree
with Horace and La Fontaine
into a pleasant immersion dream
there is a stream nearby making noise and jumping
and rush to the wet shore
and the light current is annoying to hide
to the neighboring grove and meadow
but now it's already midday in the bright hall
fun round table set
bread and salt on a clean blanket
steaming cabbage soup wine in a glass
and the pike lies on the tablecloth
neighbor noisy crowd
rise interrupt silence
sit down bowl listen to the ringing
all praise bacchus and pomon
and with them red spring
here is a secluded office
where am i moscow tired
deceptive beauty in the distance
frowning concern in the distance
and that wicked sorceress
which turns the whole world around
the trumpet thunders incessantly
and to be remembered to be called glory
live with natural simplicity
with philosophical fun
and with the muse frisky and young
Here is my fireplace in the dark evening
autumn stormy time
love under the shelter of a secluded canopy
before he thoughtfully dreamed
voltaire wieland read
or in a minute inspiration
scribble carelessly stanza
and then burn your creation
here but quickly ghost
born in a magic lantern
flicker on the white canvas
dream find disappear
like a shadow on the morning dawn
meanwhile, as in a cell, silent
I dream of surrendering myself into captivity
hand careless and lazy
scatter rhymes here and there
I hear the stomping, I hear the neighing
flash the patterned saddle cloth
in the brilliant mentia radiance
a hussar rushes under the window
and where are you peaceful picture
lovely rural simplicity
among the warlike valley
to fly on the wing is my dream
the fire in the camp burns out
between they wrap a cloak
with a gray-haired moustached Cossack
lie far away bayonet sparkle
dashing laugh reins bite
and occasionally thunder rumbles
fly with a high roll
my chest trembles with battle
with the shine of battle-hardened damask steel
fire blaze gaze and I
fly to the death of the enemy
my horse in a row enemy eagle
rush with a formidable rider
to rain down blows with a swing
oh you fatherly lary
save the young man in battle
there whistle saber it is jagged
there the feathered shako sways
with a Circassian burka on the shoulder
and silently bowing to the mane
he rushes arrow on slippery field
with a cigarra smoky in the tooth
but the laurel is victory
fighter from the cup world drink
military glory forgotten
hurry to your humble refuge
found on the battlefield and honor
one disease crutch
forever leave a saber revenge
already see into the gloomy distance
my cramped house dark grove
gate garden near pond
and again I am a humble philosopher
take refuge in my dear shelter
and the world is forgotten and they are forgotten
peace of mind to taste again
say about heart priceless friend
a dream and friendship and love
hitherto carefree in playfulness
wander through the roses my day
in innocent clarity of heart
not knowing is torment I am love
but quickly rush away day after day
where is the early trace of childhood
the lovely age will pass
the first flower to fade
my heart doesn't beat for joy anymore
with a cute looking butterfly
that in the air to circle and curl
with a breath of quiet breeze
and incomprehensible anxiety
blaze smoulder blood burn
and all the language of the heart is clear
oh tender passion to speak
girlfriend age golden
girlfriend red children's year
do you see the light of sight
friend heart sweet sushkov
Your image is everywhere with me
everywhere with me i'm a ghost cute
in the darkness of midnight sad
at the hour of the golden dawn
then at the end of the alley is dark
evening quiet time
one in languid thoughtfulness
you i see before me
your shawl is not covered
lower your gaze to your chest
in cheek love bashful color
all quietly glimmers the moonlight
frown poplar move
already the gloom is dim, a veil
lie down on a distant hill
and the curtain of the grove flows
over the quiet-sleeping wave
silver the moon
you are alone in the grove with me
leaning on my crutch
stand under a thick willow
and the wind frolics in the twilight
on the snow chest coolness blow
play curl of hair
and the leg is slender to draw
through your snow-white cover
then the hour is deep midnight
in front of your tower is tall
gloomy winter time
I'm waiting for the beauty dear
ready sleigh darkness thick
I'm the only one sleeping and feeling sad
call the hour lazy fight
and a dull rustling sound seems to be heard
and now I can hear the sweet whisper
It's lovely to go off the porch
breathe a little, walk stealthily
and the girl hugs each other
to gallop a horse into the distance to set off
the mane is loose in the wind
rush into the snowy depths
cuddle timidly you to me
breathe a little bit we are stunned
in delight feeling numb
but what is the dream of flying away
Alas, I am happy to be in a dream
in the joyful muse silence
simple sound of the flute
my friend i sing for you
dream young singer destiny
pet muse and inspiration
strive for fantasy
find pleasure in the heart
and trouble threatens the way
minute of happiness golden
Let me not twist the clofo
in a dream all the joy of the earth
fate is an all-powerful poet
child of grace and imagination
in a fiery rush of the soul
careless brush pleasure
I'm a friend of the heart write

hope timid devil
smile darling lovely
and the look is the most beautiful
around the thin hebei waist
tie a lady's belt

throw it over a quivering chest
so that she can breathe under him too
want to secretly sigh
imagine dream love shy
and the one that breathes
hand lover happy
I sign my name below
tomorrow with a candle of a penny
appear before the image of the saint
my friend stay I'm alive
but there will be death under the scythe
Sazonov be my servant
and Peshel is my healer
squint, curly, moustache
hussar with a majestic smile
twirl a curl around your finger
sage with shaving beard
swing quietly head
with a sigh, the mustachioed man said
hussar is all perishable under the moon
like wave after wave
pass through the kingdom and the century

where is the drama skinny cleon
rush all the time river

so as not to crush the mustache with rashness

he quietly wraps up
Don't dare put your nose in the pillow
and in deep sleep he cherishes
and in the morning he curls again
for a long, cheerful dinner
in a circle of gray-haired hussars
and the black-moustached daredevil
cheerful guest lover passionate
For whose health should the bottle break?
horse beauty and mustache

in a row the core with a crack crash
and you over the dashing saddle
don't waste your mind, don't waste your memory
first grab the curly mustache
and the saber is faithful later
fetter magical power
alone with hottie darling
you suffer alone
in rapture, voluptuous bliss
wander chest-deep beautiful
and twist the menacing mustache of another
be proud of the hussar but remember forever
that everything in the world is fleeting
fly destructive hours
ruddy cheek turn yellow
and black curls turn gray
and old age to pluck mustache
blessed is he who in the city noise

Praise be to the worthy newspaperman
and Nikolet the late poet
and the restless count tail
and all that is in the world
it's too complicated to write
it will be cold and dark
which is very shameful and sinful
pretty battle rush thunder
the bloody sword becomes dull
and death is the fatal wing
make a threatening noise over the universe
the king's gaze will come true
europe solid peace to establish
shackles to overthrow the villain
be able to restrain the battle again
he saw Moscow in flames
and be overthrown horror world
cover the fallen head
blessed porphyry
and the darkness will be drawn to surround
flow and suddenly with violent betrayal
already erect his shaky throne
and the mouth is torn away from the universe
to calm down, not to rush, thunder
don't shine the bloody sword
and the battle is a deadly wing
do not rush menacingly over the universe
Praise be to the heroic youth
with hero marvelous albion
he is faithful to lead into the last battle
and avenge Lily Bourbon
before it the rebellious thunder rumbles
flow in the wake of the bloody shield
thunderstorm he in battle darkness fly
and spread the glory of brilliance
he flows young blood
on he shine ulcer honor
to marry to marry he love
he is worthy to be a warrior of revenge
let the poet with the censer be hired
chase happiness and rumor
I am a terrible light to pass my dark century
the path to fade into obscurity
let the singer thunder praise
demigod give immortality
my voice is quiet and sonorous string
do not proclaim the silence of the shelter
let love ovid sing
I do not give rest to the citer
happy day cupid i dont twist
I dream to sing the priceless gift of Morpheus
and teach as it should be in silence
to rest in a pleasant deep sleep
come oh laziness come to my desert
you call coolness and peace
in one you I see my goddess
ready for all for the young guest
all is quiet here annoying noise take cover
beyond my threshold to the bright window
transparent descend canvas
and into the dark niche where the gloom reigns
slightly creeping uncertain daylight
here is my sofa come to the abode of peace
Queen, I am now your captive
everything is yours here is paint brush and lyre
teach me to drive my hand
and you, my friend, are a lovely muse
which love forgets the bonds
which dominion is the earth
Of course I prefer a calm sleep
O sage, I wonder how you can
for you alone I am now the throne of Morpheus
poetry flower twine
for you alone sing the bliss
listen with a smile of condescension
my poem lesson pleasure
in appoint nature nega hour
do you want to forget yourself every time
in the stillness of the night, amidst the general silence
in an embrace playful dreaming
hurry to the peaceful rural shelter
you can live there both idly and carefree
it's like paradise there but away from the city
where the scream and noise torment the sloth forever
I agree I can do it all day long
with a charming girl catch fun shadow
yawn in a scarf shine in fashionable light
to the ball at night to spin on the parquet
but can one taste the joy of sleep
the shadow falls, only I am ready to fall asleep
deceive the ghost of the night
and now the lantern is already lit
on a crazy four-horse
knock rattle wheel golden
roll the arrogance under my window
I doze again again the street trembles
to fly to a boring ball of distraction
oh my god should i really sleep here
to be tormented by insomnia all night
there's still knocking and it's already light there
and where is my dream is it not good in the village
there is a grove, a leaf fluttering
in the meadow a mysterious stream murmurs
golden field valley silence
in the village all the languor is inclined to sleep
oh sweet dream nothing to disturb
one rooster wakes up the dawn
raise your sharp cry to be able to be
he is dangerous he can wake up
so let him go to the seraglio
sultan chicken proud prisoner
or the villager to call to the field
we want to sleep dear friend
A hundred times blessed is he who can forget his sleep
in the distance the capital, a carriage and a rooster
but sweetness is a cheerful night dream
don't think you're enjoying it for nothing
among the peaceful with there is no any work
Well, what do you need to do, sir?
laziness is commendable but that's the limit
watch clitus in pillow gray-haired
to torment a pampered patient
to sit all my life with gout and melancholy
the day is coming, the miserable day is coming, suffocating
groan crawl from bed to sofa
sit all day when there is a night fog
to dim the light into the darkness to spread out
from the sofa to the bed to crawl
and how will the unfortunate one spend the night
into a peaceful sleep into a pleasant dream
no, sleep is not joy but torment
not a poppy heavy hand
he morpheus closes the languid eye
and slowly pass the turn
for the poor watch gloomy night
I don't want to be a mutual friend of Bert's
prescribe you a heavy movement
stubborn plow hunting pleasure
no in the grove I'm lazy to invite
my friend, how beautiful the morning is here
in the silence of the field through the mystery of the oak grove
like a young day shine proudly clear
brighten up, overtake each other
murmur brook shine silent bank
there is still dew on the fresh grass
golden lake motionless doze wave
my friend take your staff
go to the forest wander through the valley
steep hill get tired at the top
and in debt night deep your sleep be
as soon as the shadow dresses the sky
let joy enter our life
joy god with wide full cup
and Bacchus will reign with his whole court
feast moderately with each other
glass three hiss wave
ruddy wine pour you full
but who is fat with puffy cheeks
don't come knocking at the door
I'm glad he is but only for lunch
and in a friendly manner I clean up at noon
his gift but right in the evening
I am much more friendly with his neighbor
don't dineholy that's the law
who all dear light sleep
You are a child, you are wise, you are lazy
deceptive calming shadow
don't sleep day about grief grief you
when to nap get used to it for an hour
that your peace is deeply insensitive
the dream is true from you already give eco
don't know funny you dream
your whole century of unbearable languor
and a boring dream and a boring awakening
and the day flows among the eternal darkness
but if in the wilderness there is a waterfall nearby
what is under the mountain seething and boiling
lovely sleep fatigue reward
when the waves make noise, fly off to the wild shore
cover the gaze with a misty veil
hug you and quiet hand
to bow down to the soft moss to overshadow
oh sweetly near noisy water oblivion
may your peace last longer
I'm envious I'm a lucky man enjoyment
Will there be bad weather?
winter day in the late quiet light
sit alone without a candle in the office
everything is quiet around there are no more birches
hour by hour it gets dark window light
some ghost is wandering on the ceiling
the coal and bluish smoke turn pale
as light steam leaves the chimney
and here is his invisible rod
Morpheus casts a false gloom on everything
darken the gaze of Candida from your hand
closing down to fall on the knee suddenly
sigh you hand fall on the table
and the head rolls from shoulder to chest
you doze over you world blood
unexpected dream pleasant many dreams
mental anguish magic healer
my friend morpheus my longtime comforter
you always i sacrifice love
and you are a priest who has long blessed
Should we forget that golden time?
Should we forget the blissful hour of bliss
when to hide in a corner in the evening
I call and wait for you in peace
I myself am not happy with my talkativeness
but the childhood year is a fond memory
ah should i keep silent about my mother
oh charm mysterious night
when in a cap in an old robe
she is a spirit prayer to deflect
I cross myself with zeal
and I begin to whisper and tell
o dead man o feat of the god
I was so terrified I couldn't move
barely breathe, cuddle up under the blanket
can't feel either my legs or my head
under the image a simple night light made of clay
slightly illuminate deep wrinkle
dredge antique great-grandmother's cap
and a long mouth where two teeth are chattering
everything in the soul involuntary fear to instill
I tremble and quietly finally
languor sleep on the eye fall
then the crowd with azure height
on tray rose winged dream
wizard sorceress fly away
deception my dream enchant
I get lost in a rush of sweet thoughts
into the wilderness of the forest amidst the Murom desert
meet dashing colonel and dobrynya
and the young mind rushes into fiction
but you pass by the night serene
and youth is already approaching age
serve i alban brush tender
and I dream of young love to taste
and where is she born delight
and at that very moment the delight will be destroyed
I wake up and look at the sky for the day
but still the moon is silent and hides in the darkness
and around me is the deep night shadow
but my dream is quiet, carefree son Parnassus
in the silence of the night I do not fight with rhyme
never to see either Phoebus or Pegasus again
not an old yard some old muse
I'm not a hero, I don't yearn for my laurels
calm and bliss do not trade
I don't imagine a terrible battle at night
I'm not a rich man and the barking of a gatekeeper's dog
do not disturb my pleasant dream
I'm not a villain with excitement and melancholy
do not see the bloody ghost in a dream
murderous child prejudice
and at a late hour a terrible pale fear
don't frown sullenly in your head
recently dark time
when the desert moon
flow misty path
I see a girl at the window
sitting alone thoughtfully
breathe into the secret fear of the chest
she looks with excitement
down the dark path down the hill
I'm here to whisper hastily
and the maiden's trembling hand
I'm afraid to open the window
moon cover darkness
I am a lucky man to say with longing
you are joy to wait alone
when is the evening time
and I open the window
bless the poet in the silence of the Parnassian canopy
I bow my knee before the muse with trepidation
dangerous path with hope to fly
I draw lots for Phoebus and the lyre is my destiny
fear inexperienced inglorious fall
but I have no power to subdue the ardent attraction
I do not heed the terrible sentence of death
hidden in the age of the sacred judge
guard faithful last year confidant muse beloved
and pale envy is an unshakable object
friendly I attention encourage
and Dmitry weak gift with a smile to praise
and our glorious elder, the chosen singer king
winged genius and grace to crown
in tears hug i tremble hand
and I predict happiness unknown to me
and you, nature, are doomed to song
Is it not you who I hand to give in covenant sacred love
can I forget the hour when I am in front of you
I stand silent and the lightning stream
soul to the sublime soul your fly
and secretly unite in rapture to blaze
no no I will decide without fear on a difficult path
brave faith filled the chest
creator immortal pet inspiration
you are the goal I show in the fog distance
fly to the unknown brave dream
and it seems that your genius needs to rush through me
but what under the formidable Parnassian rock
what a spectacle to behold
into the terrible darkness of the cave depths
enmity and envy sullen son
sublime creator zoilus note
sit nonsense squad fighting
far away the wild lyre rushes sharp howl
Varangian verse squeal Varangian build
laughter general he answer over gloomy crowd
in the darkness two ghosts bowed their heads
one on the pile sits down and prose and verse
heavy fruit midnight labor
deceased ode poem forgotten grave
with a smile listen howl stop-folder frail
before he tear to pieces moan tilim
the iron pen creaked in his finger
and pull the dry hexameter behind you
spondee is rigid and dactyls are tight
zealous muse glorify singer
You are proud, you inflated specimen of meviy
but who else in the smoke crazy smoking
stand among the crowd friend ignorance
solemn praise to he rush noise
and he he tramples rhyme and taste and mind
Are you this weak child someone else's lesson
envious proud cold sumarokov
without strength without fire with mediocre mind
Prejudice Obligatory Crown
and throw off the pinds and the damned racist
Is he a dwarf to compete with a giant?
Is he going to dispute that laurel crown?
in which our immortal singer will shine
fun russian midnight wonder
no in the quiet summer he stomps silently
the seal of oblivion is already on his forehead
the next century what can it transmit
fear grace cynical flute
and the rough finger on the lyre will become ossified
let him be the one to extol in speech
appear depreo disappear chapel
and what if you're always funny, you'll always stay funny
ignoramus foster ignorance blind
they hide it in their dark shelter
there prose and verse bravely forge everything
there the whole enemy science is all deaf but not mute

one slavic ode hromada gromozdit
another in mad tragedy wheeze
that faithful his rebellious union
on stage erect yawn muse
immortal genius rip off parnassus think
hand shake blow it slide
to throw in vain with an envious dagger
verse wound he cast down into dust magazine
when a critic whistles towards a fellow he runs away
and the poppy crown of Thespis they retinue
all hands rely on that tilimahid
swear revenge employee insult
worry rebel frantic crowd
trouble who gives birth to a sensitive soul
who secretly can captivate the beauty gentle lyre
who dares to whistle a humorous satire
who speaks truthful language
and Russian stupidity is not to want to hit the forehead
he is the enemy of the fatherland, he is the sower of debauchery
and speech rain falls on the co-state
and you rise up, Parnassian priest
nature and work educated singer
in happy heresy and taste and teaching
strike impudent friend ignorance

pouring from heaven both life and eternal light

ignorance resign oneself to lowering one's cold gaze
arrogant rhetorician illiterate cathedral
but to see and proclaim the truth is dangerous
I'm already frowning terribly
and the death sentence talent to thunder
must I endure persecution and be my lot
that need boldly into the distance the road is straight
teaching hand give support you
their malice is not afraid I am firm Karamzin
I am an example that this crazy cry is a squad
let the outcast Phoebus talk
they prose not a verse not send a gift from heaven
their glory they are shame creation laughter mind
and into darkness to arise to fall into darkness
rise noise flute field
to announce my solitude
and with the image of a drag mistress
last fly dream
the night shadow is already rolling down from the sky
rise dawn shine pale day
and all around me there is deafening desolation
no, she's not here, I'm on the shore
where to go darling on a clear evening
on the shore on the green meadow
I can't find a barely visible trace
leave her beautiful leg
wander thoughtfully into the wilderness of the forest
I pronounce the name incomparable
I call her and the voice is lonely
empty valley call she to give
to come to the stream dream to attract
his stream flows slowly
do not tremble in they are an unforgettable image
no, it's not sweet spring
I say goodbye to bliss and to my soul
already autumn cold hand
head birch and linden naked
she makes noise in the deserted oak grove
there the yellow leaf whirls day and night
stand fog on the wave cooled
and you can hear the instant whistle of the wind
field hill familiar oak grove
keeper of sacred silence
my witness is longing fun
forget you until sweet spring
when to strike the last hour of happiness
when in tears over the abyss I wake up
and trembling for the last time
to touch your hand your lips
yes remember all my heart is terrified
but to drown out the unbearable sadness
I don't mean eternal separation
all the joy now carries away into the distance
forget yourself in a dream stomp flour
despondency destructive boredom
hermit shelter not to visit
my sorrow is a delight to meet the muse
I console myself and friendship quiet look
my soul to illuminate the cold darkness
how little I know love and heart
hours go by they day pass
but sorrow does not bring joy
and not to bear the oblivion of the phial
oh darling everywhere you are with me
but I'm sad and secretly I'm sad
Will the day shine beyond the blue mountain
does the night rise with the autumn moon
I still look for you, my lovely friend
Will I fall asleep only dreaming about you
you are alone in the wrong dream
to think involuntarily to call
I listen to your voice, I hear it
absentmindedly sit between each other
indistinct I they noisy conversation
look at them with a motionless eye
they no longer recognize my cold gaze
and you and I about lyre become sad
confidante my soul sick
your string is a sad, dull ringing
and only love you voice do not forget
oh faithful sadness sadness with me
let your careless chant
to portray my despondency
and listen to your clanking
let the thoughtful maiden sigh
long since wise to seek
forget truth trace
and it takes a long, long time to interpret
old talk old man
to say the truth naked
to get into a well secretly
and drink water together
shout here find her
but someone is a mortal benefactor
and almost a strong old man
their important stupidity witness
water and screaming tire
leave invisible our
think first about wine
and drain the bowl to the last drop
see the truth at the bottom
deep night in the field
long time to lie down to cover
and faintly into the pale cloud
star desert shine
at the dying fire
in the wrong darkness fog
silently two stand
to darken the height
all sleep only a wave of rebellious murmur
spread into the silence of the night
yes audible from give deaf
damask steel ringing and horse stomping
crowd rider young
to go to the oak grove silently
the horse they tremble and puff
head shake impatient
already the field rider is in a hurry
oak grove roof leave unsteady
horse to pet and tame
and with a proud smile whisper
their face is burning with joy
fire blaze angry eye
only you are a warlike poet
dull as the twilight of midnight
and pale as autumn light
with the head gloomily bow
with hidden grief in the chest
sad thought to captivate
he drives ahead silently
the singer is gloomy what's wrong with you
alone before the battle you are sad
bow down fearless head
lower the reins and the saber
is the idle slave really bliss
joyful peace is your soul
than our stormy raid
and the night the battle knock of the sword
the path of war may be dangerous
our enviable proud lot
are you now the terrible death
you never turn pale in the midst of battle
you we ripen under the sword
with a calm, bold forehead
always between the first row
Wherever there is a battle, thunder falls
with a victorious click to unite
your voice is our glory to sing
and now you are wild in despondency
like a fugitive warrior, to become dumb
but slowly the singer is sad
head and gaze lift
look sullenly into the distant gloom
and a sigh shakes the chest
deep sleep in the valley take
Alone we rush into the darkness of the night
to have a presentiment of the desired end
I call the last fight
break the chain fate cruel
I fly into the fire with my brother
fly in thunderstorm and lonely
my horse runs out into the valley
about you who is here with me
to suppose the grave boundary
say sweet tear
your sweet long sleep
but for me no one breathes
I am overtaking silence
Elvina death news hear
and she does not sigh secretly
and you keep fate
for happiness life's joy
let the mistress shed tears
Bless your return
for the cup sweet salvation
oh brother remember singer
his love his torment
and glory terrible end
happy is he who is passionate about himself
without horror dare to admit
who in the unknown fate
hope timid cherish
who is the moon misty ray
lead at midnight voluptuous
who is the quietly faithful key
open the door to his beautiful
but I don't have a dull life
joy secret pleasure
fade hope early bloom
color life dry up from torment
sadly youth flies away
hear old age threat
but I forget love
my love forget or tears
why leave the cloud
solitary moon
and on the pillow through the window
shine dim to direct
phenomenon cloudy its
you wake up a sad dream
love vain suffering
and my proud mind
lull the desire a little
fly away memory
fall asleep unhappy love
That night will never happen again
when calm shines
your mysterious ray
penetrate through the dark ash
and pale pale illuminate
my beauty lover
what are you delight voluptuousness
before the secret charm joy
direct love direct happiness
Will joy rush back?
what minute do you fly
then such a quick turn
and the shadow slightly thins out
before the unexpected dawn
why did you take a month to roll away
and sink into the bright sky
why does the morning ray shine
why should i say goodbye to my darling
Can you hear the voice of the night beyond the grove?
singer love singer his sadness
when the field is silent in the morning hour
the flute sound is dull and simple
can you hear
Will you meet me in the deserted darkness of the forest?
singer love singer his sadness
Is it sad to notice the smile?
or a quiet gaze to fill with melancholy
meet you
Should you sigh or listen to the quiet voice
singer love singer his sadness
when you go to the forest you are a young man, you see
meet the gaze of his dull eye
should you sigh?
dear and old acquaintance
oh my good sleep guardian
where are you under the deserted roof
I'm already making a bed for peace
in the silent silence of the night
come blow out my lamp
my dream is to bless
until the morning only give joy
my painful love
hide from memory the sad
separation is a sad sentence
let me see your sweet gaze
let me hear my dear voice
when will the night's darkness rush away
and you are mine to leave the eye
oh if only the soul could
forget love until new night
I listen to Lilu at the keyboard
she has a lovely languid voice
magic sadness undead we
like the night the breeze of zephyr
a tear fall from the eye
and I say the singer is cute
your magical voice is sad
but the word my dear
magical gentle song lila
love one fun life cold
love one torment heart
she gives only one joyful moment
and the sorrow is not visible and the end
A hundred times blessed is he who is charming in his youth
catch this quick moment in flight
who to joy and bliss unknown
bashful bow beauty
but who loves not to sacrifice himself
you feel free singer
Before my dear, you humble yourself soul
you sing passion and proud hand
beauty to carry her crown
Blind Cupid is cruel and biased
you distribute thorns and myrtle
with Permessian queen consonant
some of you are happy to point out
another forever bind sorrow
and send the fire of love to the unfortunate as a gift
Tibullus's heir and the guy
you know the priceless sweetness of life
as the morning ray shines your day
singer love young sing joy
incline the lips to burn the lips
in the embrace of a lover to die
poem love quietly sigh
you don't dare to envy anymore
singer love you know sadness
and your day will flow through thorns
you call your end with excitement
the end comes and life goes on
don't see it you're a minute's fun
but not finding bliss your day
you meet at least glory
and you are your immortal torment
it is not my destiny to appoint that fate
under the gloomy canopy of clouds
into the wilderness valley into the sad darkness forest
alone wandering sad and gloomy
in the evening hour over the gray lake
in melancholy I often cry with tears
but the murmur of the wave is my lamentation
and the noise of the oak grove in response only I listen
will the soul be interrupted by a cold sleep
poetry ignite or rapture
heat is born and it cools down quietly
fruitless pass inspiration
let her be glorified by another
one to love he loves and loves
love love but she will not touch
sufferer voice she does not smile
his verse is casual and simple
why should i sing under the maple field
I leave the deserted zephyr
the lyre has been abandoned forever
and a weak gift like light smoke to hide
I see death she sits down in silence
at my peaceful threshold
I see the coffin the door opens he
the soul grows dim, grows cold
I'm leaving soon, my friend
and my sorrowful life
no one will notice the trace anymore
my last glance is my eye
ray immortality not to meet
and the lamp of the young day goes out
insignificance calm darkness illuminate
forgive the sad world where the path is dark
over the abyss for I lie
where is faith quiet I do not console
where i love where i cant love
forgive luminary day forgive sky curtain
silent night mist morning star sweet hour
familiar hill stream deserted voice
silence mysterious forest
and forgive everything for the last time
and you who am I in the world god
secret subject to get off and grief pledge
forgive pass all already go out my flame
I'm going to a cold grave
and death is the fatal gloom
with torment love cover life sad
and you are a friend when you are deprived of power
barely breathing in painful struggle
say I you about friend I love
and the quiet spirit to die in exhaustion
my friend then go to her
say take he is eternal darkness
and it may be my fate
She sighs over the coffin urn
slowly my day is drawn
and every moment in the sad heart to multiply
all sorrow unhappy love
and all dreams are madness to disturb
but I keep silent, my murmur is not heard
I am a tear shed I am a tear of consolation
my soul captivate melancholy
in they bitter find pleasure
oh life is flying for an hour, don't you feel sorry
disappear into darkness empty ghost
I am dear my love my torment
let them die but let them die loving
what a cheerful friend
my disturb you silence
singing the last farewell
my muse has already fallen silent
It is in vain that I take the lyre in my hand
rattle joy at the feast
and to loosen the string
search for lost sound
God, you still have to give
golden day golden night
and aim for love
fire fulfill eye
play sing about friend
to lose the fleeting evening
and your joy is carefree
I will smile through tears
I think that love will fade away forever
that in the heart of evil passion to silence the rebellious voice
that friendship is finally a joyful star
sufferer bring to the pier reliable
I think I rest near the true shore
already from afar look point hand
a distressed swimmer on the sail
wear a furious thunderstorm
and I say I am a hundred times blessed
whose age is free and beautiful
as the century spring rushes by clear
and passion not to be darkened
who does not suffer in vain in love
who is the unknown sad captivity
blessed but I'm blessed more
I break the chain of torment
again I am friendship I am at liberty
and life is a gloomy field
cheerful shine enchant
but what can I say, I'm unhappy
minute I fall asleep in the wrong silence
but a dark love lurked within me
my passionate flame will not go out
fun to call in the crowd my friend
want to tune the lira to its former tune
want to still sing the beauty of the young
the joy of Bacchus and the dolphin
In vain I keep silent tired hand
lie languid on lyre naughty
I am still burning and indifferent to sadness
to look at the game from afar youth
love is poison our day
run with the crowd deceptive dream
do not burn my soul
fire tormenting desire
fly ghost cupid I'm not yours
I give away my joy I give away my peace
throw one I into the insensible nature
or let the hope of a wing still fly
let me fall asleep again and in a painful chain
dream of sweet freedom
in captivity boring to fade away
barely developed life color
stealthily fly away youth
and the trail of her sadness trail
with a minute of insensible birth
to tender youth year
I still don't know pleasure
and there is no happiness in a languid heart
from the threshold of life into the distance
I look impatiently
there there I dream of pleasure
but I'm for the ghost to fly
golden wing develop
magical gentle beauty
love to be young
and fly in front of me
I follow but the goal is distant
but the goal is not achieved dear
when is joy illumined
happiness comes quick moment
when to flare up in radiance
dim light young day
and my dark path will be illuminated
smile is my companion
yesterday i gave orders to masha
to sketch out a rhyme in a couplet
and I promise as a reward
thank you in prose write
hurry to carry out orders
don't dare wait a year

Saint Bacchus with a merry friend
it used to be that wine sang water poem
in a bad verse a bad writer scold
or friendship to weave a wreath and friendship to yawn
and to recite a sleepy verse in a dream
and even to repent I am a hermit to sin
I am the first to sing love innocent beginning
but so mysterious with such a word analysis
with such modesty bashful
why not blush timidly
I would listen to the virgin goats too
but hiding from me is a Parnassian amusement
It won't be long before I fall asleep
I don't dream for long, I dream of the muse and glory
I involuntarily awaken strict experience
fall asleep between roses and thorns I wake up
see that not yet genius print
hunt mortal on rhyme babble
compare your poem with mine smile
and that's enough writing

soul desire
and catch a dream

I'll fall asleep again
to bewitch
and in the morning
tired again
let him die

my spring and summer red
go to the ends of the earth

God, you are all more honored
ah if only i could be born again
would you really serve like that?
about deliy dragay
hurry my beauty
star love golden
ascend to heaven
silently the month will roll
hurry your argus to leave
and sleep closes his eyes
hidden under the canopy
oak forest silence
where the current is isolated
silver wave
murmur with sad Philomela
ready shelter love cheerful
and the moon shines
cast a shadow night
we are our own cover
and the shade of the grove dozes
and quickly a moment of love
I am full of grief and desire to fly
hurry to have a date
rush into my embrace
are you in front of me
share mine
separate from you
how much do i cry
are you in front of me
or a dream a dream
I seduce
do you recognize each other
he's not something to be
but you are a friend
still don't forget
and repeat sadly
Do I love you dear?
how to be be
what can compare now
with my share
here comes a tear
up to your cheek
do feel ashamed
what can compare now
with my share
from the fifteenth spring
like a lily at dawn
beauty bloom
and languid breathing
and the languid light of the gaze
and the chest trembling
and the rose is a delicate color
change all youth
Lilu can't be captured
merry round dance
one at sleepy water
she hides in the forest
sigh and pine
and she is there erotic
when the night is dark
She is modest in bed
catch a quiet sleep
with the sorceress dream
and quiet melancholy
to fulfill the heart he
and pour into a dream
taste the pleasure
and whisper about Philo
who's there in the dark cave
evening time
fetter languid laziness
rest in peace with you
so you already taste it
all joy love
you feel about pouring
excitement in the blood
and with trembling confusion
with a burning face
you breathe rapture
Cupid under the wing
oh sacrifice passion tender
burn in silence
rest in peace
to the fiery dawn
for you the flow is playful
gloomy darkness dress
and the silent month
foggy light of flight
here the rose bends
above you in the dark shelter
and the wind will hide
where love reigns
but who is there near the cave
lie in the thick grass
on the altar of Venus
he looked at her with annoyance
bend down between flowers
shaggy leg
above the sad eye
hang two horns
then the faun is a gloomy resident
forest and steep mountain
a pestering persecutor
shepherdess young
Favorite Cupid
beautiful philo
he has been a rival for a long time
to the shelter of lust
he hears a sigh of happiness
and a languid moan of negativity
unhappy in silence
suffering cup drink
and in vain jealousy
burning tear to shed
but here is the queen of night
slide down behind the forest
and the silent morning star
blush the sky
marshmallow whisper
and a faun in a dense forest
run to hide sadness
in the gorge wild mountain
one in the morning to pour
unsteady leg
in the middle of a dense grove
walk thoughtfully
oh how soon will the darkness of night
with a beautiful moon
you take over the sky
oh soon the dark forest
turn blue in the fog
to the west the sky
but a rustle behind the bush
she sounds deaf
and suddenly the eye flashed
before her is the forest god
like a spring breeze
she flies into the forest
he chases after her
and trembling pouring
all the secret to reveal
your young beauty
and the tender chest opens
kiss breeze
and a slender leg
to unwittingly expose oneself
flutter over the grass
the shepherdess breathes timidly
and the faun for himself
everything is close, close to hear
she already feels it
fire is his breath
all efforts in vain
you are a faun's destined
but noisy wave
beauty hide
the river is her grave
no pour save
Eros the Golden-winged
and gentle cupid
young lila to the rescue
fly from all sides
throw everything citera
and peaceful with there is Venus
by the trembling wave
they carry it into the cave
love desert temple
lucky to be there already
and now with Philo
she has fun drinking
and passion light moan
interrupt the silence
sleep peacefully pour
on the rose bliss and sleep
and extinguish its beam
the moon is behind the cloud
hang your head
unfortunate god forest
one with evening darkness
wander along the shore
forgive love and joy
he said with a sigh
to waste youth in sorrow
I am doomed to condemn
suddenly from the forest a ruddy
stagger in front of him
satire appear drunk
with a circular jug
he is a dim eye
look for the way home
and goat's leg
barely step over
go go and bump into
on my faun
recoil with laughter
lean towards him
Are you this dear brother?
cry out satyr gray
in what country is unknown
I'm dating you
ah, the faun said sadly
my day will fade
I change everything
I am unhappy in love
what to hear from amur
you suffer and feel sad
little troublemaker
and you idolize
is oblivion possible
to scoop into a jug
and a cup for consolation
fill to the brim
and the foam will sparkle
and hiss to the edge
and with the first phial
Cupid is already forgotten
who is so impudent to own
your beauty
unfaithful who dares
blaze hand
wander chest-deep passionate
languish sigh
and with lila beautiful
to die in delight
so you change
beauty captivate
hurry to love about pouring
and change again
pass delight happiness
like a light sleep in the morning
where is the secret of lust
where is the gentle palemon
about pour wither rose
minute love
to know sadness and tears
and now we have to pick thorns
in a destructive desire
fly for a year
and old age into the distance
beauty threaten
Cupid already bows
part with beauty
and after cupid
fun hide swarm
the shepherdess wanders into the forest
sad and alone
who is there to find
suddenly she sees a faun
goat-legged philosopher
to lie under a linden tree
and a foamy phial
wreath decorate horns
lazily drain
even though the faun is not a find
for lila the old child
but to think of beauty
love to cast a net
sneak up on, rush towards
a languid gaze at the faun
and I tend to hear
to the end of the conversation
but the faun has an evil smile
foam your phial
shake your head
beauty say
no, I'm not going to rest
my other friend catch
there is time for love
for wisdom another
I used to be you
to be captivated by madness
used to admire
treacherous beauty
and the heart smolders with passion
to you I attract
it happened but fortunately
what will happen will happen
oh, I need to have pity
comrade friend
beauty dashing
I will torture you to the end
I feel sad all the time
my bitter fate
carry a circular
open the cellar
there, there, they are stored in ice
bottle proud line
and the porter is hiding
discharge barrel
we are liberal stuttering
to he show the way
let's all go wandering
fall asleep under a barrel
in they are the heart's consolation
award for singer
and torment love oblivion
and my heat is my verse
from all-night vigil evening go home
Antipievna and Marfushka swear
Antipievna is excellent at getting excited
stand shout manage me with you
you think that i will already forget
that night when to climb into the corner
You and your godson Vanya are being naughty
stand about everything find out hubby
Are you threatening to answer Marfushka?
Vanyusha, he's still a child.
and what about the matchmaker Trofim that you have?
and day and night the whole city knows it
Keep quiet godmother and you, like me, are a sinner
and every word is offensive
in someone else's straw you see
and not see even a log in yourself
when the poet is delighted
read your ode or congratulatory poem
when the narrator draws out a phrase
when to listen to a parrot
can't find anything to laugh about
fall asleep yawn into a handkerchief
wait a minute when you can say
Have a nice date
but alone with his beauty
or among smart people
true happiness is to come alive
be happy laugh sing
prolong your peaceful vigil
and sing at the end of the evening
your friend your bottle
Have a nice date
friend life is fleeting
and everything will float away with time
love is also a flyer
bird our spring
too early she disappear laugh furtively
and forever to forgive hope
when she flutters away, to say the least
Have a nice date
time to run sad and cruel
and sooner or later go to the next world
sometimes it happens not so rarely
chance to save us from the grave
remove horde suffering
and a black horrible skeleton
go knock on another door
Have a nice date
but what do i feel that i get tired
tire my dear listener
Okay, I'm going down from Parnassus
he does not create for the singer
I inspire verse
I have power over chorus
enough to forgive the pen
Have a nice date
with reverent soul
come closer young traveler
love for desert shelter
here she is happy to be me once
to fade into fiery delight
and it's time for us
stop for a minute
here is our little monk
poet scribe and warrior
always for everything in the whole place
nettle he is worthy
with martyn pop he is a regular
with Frolov mathematician
Engelhardt-hero joins
and in an instant he is a diplomat
God knows why the philosopher poet
to yours and mine long ago angry
I don't argue with the scientist, there's a crowd of them
but there is no reason to scold
what I give is joy and peace
what if you weren't mine
what if i wasn't yours
sickening idyll and cold than ode
from anger misanthrope from stupidity poet
how terribly nature has fun with you
when to cook for light
you are afraid of a person like a black disease
oh pathetic specimen ugly dream
console yourself evil fool have not be you
never a lover nor a friend
forget my dear Kaverin
minute playfulness immodest verse
I love first be sure
your hussar sin
to glorify the apostle Zeno's teaching
to be able to be good but neither you nor me
I know that passion is excitement
and mischief and delusion
pester our day brilliant spring
let it be smart, even if careless
sometimes we start fooling around
so far without unnecessary shame
we can fool around
everything is time everything is in its moment
all the sequence goes in a certain direction
funny and frivolous old man
funny and sedate young man
having had enough of life, the young day is a guest
say goodbye forever to fun noisy
with Venus the ardent and with Bacchus the capricious
sigh about them as if they were a friend
and old age surprises with a silent bow
now live in carelessness
love each other keep memories of them
pray and who and love
minute to catch youth
and the mob despises the jealous murmuring
She doesn't know that it is possible to live in harmony
with a verse with a map with Plato and with a glass
that frisky prank under a light blanket
and the mind is elevated and the heart can be hidden
I am your young friend again
foggy hide day separation
and brother again stretch out your hand
I will see your frisky circle again
you are still the same but your heart is not the same
it's not you anymore he's still dear
I'm not that invisible path
time to go cheerfulness carefree
to leave forever and life is fleeting
morning ray I have to turn pale
the joy has left the soul
rejected fate jealous
smile laughter and playfulness and peace
I forget everything, silent sadness
the shroud lies over the young head
In vain you are joking
and tenderness soul eloquent
I want to interrupt my heavy sleep
everything ends and playfulness is happy
in my soul the seal is erased
to remove gloomy suffering
In vain do you carry the lyre I
the past day fade away dream
and the voice dies into the insensitive string
I see only sadness in front of me
I am a scary world I am a boring daylight
go to the forest where there is no life
where is the dead darkness I hate joy
here I freeze she minute trace
you are yesterday's leaf falling, rose
do not bloom until the month's rays
rush away you day my joy
rush away you involuntarily flow tears
and I wither on the dark morning day
oh friendship I will betray oblivion
submit to fate in silence
I leave behind my heartache
I leave behind a desert and a tear
Lida is my constant friend
why through light sleep
often nega tired
I hear your quiet moan
why in love happy
see scary dream
a motionless, fearful gaze
rush into the darkness
why when to eat
quick swoon love
sometimes i notice
your secret tear
you listen absentmindedly
my fiery speech
cold hand shake
your cold gaze eye
oh priceless friend
will tears be shed forever
is a dead spouse forever
call from the grave
believe I am a prisoner grave
there to embrace eternal sleep
they are not cute, the voice is cute
not a sorrowful groan of grief
not for them spring rose
sweetness morning noise feast
frank friendship tear
and the mistress's timid call
early your unforgettable friend
sigh death sigh
and intoxicate with bliss
fall asleep on your chest
sleep crown lucky
believe love innocent we
no anger jealous
do not come from eternal darkness
quiet night no thunder
and the envious shadow
Don't get close to a lover
cause sleep day
about you who with a caustic reproach
consider gloomy unbelief a vice
run in horror then who from the first year
madly extinguish the heart's joyful light
humble pride cruel frenzy
does he have the right to your leniency
on tears pity listen brother groan
the unfortunate is not a villain, he suffers himself
who in the world to delight his soul is torment
alas, he is the first to lose consolation
look at he is not where every day
vanity casts a shadow over everything
but in silence the family under the native roof
in conversation with friendship or dark dream
find it there where the muddy stream is
walk slowly through the naked field
where the pine tree has a mysterious age-old canopy
rustle on the damp moss bend the eternal shadow
look wander he with withered soul
your terrible torment emptiness
then sadness, tears flow, then tears of regret
in vain does he seek despondency and entertainment
in vain in splendor free simplicity
nature before he opens beauty
In vain does he cast a sad gaze around himself
the mind seeks the deity but the heart does not find it
Will fate strike him deaf?
Will the momentary gift of happiness suddenly disappear?
whether in love or in friendship to embrace is it treason
and they feel the deceptive price
deprived of all support fallen away faith son
It's terrifying to see that he's alone in the world
and a powerful hand to he with the gift of peace
not to extend beyond the world
misfortune passion and weakness son
we are all born to condemn to a terrible grave
ever-mortal bonds ready for destruction
our century is unfaithful, day and night, excitement
when the cold darkness menacingly embraces us
curtain eternity shake mortal hour
terrible to feel tear last torment
and with the world to begin an unknown separation
then talk to untie the soul
oh faith you stand at the door of the grave
you night grave she quietly illuminate
and encourage with hope to let go
but my friend is terribly worried about me
only faith in silence is its joy
to revive the despondent spirit and heart with expectation
insist on talking make a date
and he, a blind sage, groaned at the coffin
with pleasure being unhappy to separate
hope sweet don't listen he hello
approach the coffin he calls out no answer
you see he is in that silent place
where the blood and sacred friend's ashes smolder
you see he is over the cold grave
where the tender deli hides the dear ashes
to rest call evening silence
to the cross to lean he insensitive head
moaning occasionally muffled to be heard
he cries but not that stream of tears pours
which is sweet to the suffering eye
and the heart is dear to its freedom
but to get rid of despair but to get rid of bitterness
into silence horror into madness frenzy
tremble and between that under the shade of a dark willow
kneel at the grave of the mother
there the young maiden is serene in sorrow
to raise a painful and tender gaze to the sky
one foggy moon illuminate
like an angel, grief appears to her
sigh slowly grave hug
everything is quiet around him, but he seems to be listening
the unfortunate one looks at her in silence
shake your head tremble and run
he hurries on but after him wanders despondency
into the highest temple with the crowd he silently entered
there only the longing of the soul multiplies
at a magnificent celebration an ancient altar
at the voice of the shepherd, at the sweet choir singing
worry his unbelief torment
he is a secret god nowhere nowhere to be seen
with dim soul shrine stand
cold to everything and alien to tenderness
with annoyance he quietly listened to the prayer
lucky man think he why can't I
passion to rebel in humble silence
forget about reason and the weak and strict
with only one faith to prostrate oneself before God
vain heart cry no no not destined
he is blessed to know unbelief alone
on the path of life into darkness the leader is sad
drag the unfortunate to the cold gates of the grave
and what to call him in the desert of the grave
who knows but there he only sees peace
Blessed is he who from his youth sees before him
dark twist two-hill height
who lives in a secret way with an innocent soul
let go captive dream
confidant god unknown storm evil
above he they silent trade time
he lulls the young stone
and with finger on lips the singer keeps peace
bashful grace heed he advice
and feel the fire in your chest even when you are young
rapturous singing on the golden lyre
o delvig happy poet
my friend and i singer and my humble way
in flower decorate goddess chant
and I am in the young god's chest
influence flame inspiration
in my infancy I was able to feel
all life is around me I breathe
all the nimble mind to charm
and the first line I quickly fly
what a quiet beauty
a minute of childhood passes
praise oh god you are powerful hand
from the fierce thunderstorm of the worldly innocence to take away
but everything passes and hides in the dark distance
freedom joy admiration
another and youth is pleasure
she i gloomy sadness
so early envy to see the bloody sight
and low slander in the darkness hidden poison
no no neither happiness nor glory
don't be dazzled let them beckon
to the brink of destruction favorite to seduce
disappear sacred heat
oblivion sweet song gift
and the voice of the string animates
to dust and lyre and crown
let it not be known that once a singer
enmity envy victim doomed
die in the morning of the year
like an early flower on the meadow
oblique timeless to fight
and live quietly in the unknown silence
offspring formidable not to remember about me
and the unfortunate coffin in the desert gloomy wild
oblivion grow creep dodder
you i command to burn soul
I'll give it to you to pass the day
with my evening dawn
my you morning unite
my century passes invisible
from the circle of laughter and grace
It's time to hide, I order
and I take him out by the hand
we will not give it mercy
who does not know how to apply
your fickle year
it's their misfortune to have only
lucky young frisky man
leave passion delusion
we live in the world two moments
give one's mind
you sweeten sorrow
my momentary youth
love dream first day
will you run away forever?
we must die twice
say goodbye to sweet dreams
here is death terrible suffering
what does it mean after not breathing
on my cloudy sunset
in the middle of the desert darkness
I'm so sorry about the loss
cheating sweet dream
then my voice is sad
I am friendship to shake hands
she is love like cute
to be in only one tenderness
I she bring to fade rose
joyful day of youth
and follow but I shed tears
that only she can follow
say parnassian my father
is the muse really a faithful lover
can't be a gentle singer
and together the guard colonel
is it really the one who sometimes
burn incense apollo for free
for honor not to dare without shame
burn gunpowder for war with hussars
and if possible the city
bellon muse and venus
here it seems the holy faith
our day every singer
I refer to the Russian buffer
and Denis is the brave man
but not on Glinka officer
quite a flat singer
no need, I'm an example
you say stop chattering
be a man and not a dragoon
parade guard training
all this is an ode not to inspire
but only the soul dries up
and to marin for the award
be able to be right behind the cocite
send to read his creation
listen my dear uncle
to step towards blind Themis
or to diplomacy braid
scribble my friend message to lida
leave the sin of war
and into sweetness of peace
write a senate resolution
and pentameter verse
and not with a hussar cornet
take an example from that poet
with the one with the hand
draw ermak
into the snow unknown light
and the mighty Megmet's captivity
and the husband is a fashionable horn
who is the god of mercy
the minister and the sweet singer
be strict honor sample
as a sample it is a syllable
everything is so, my dear uncle
Who honors human stupidity?
resolve a complicated dispute
smart who cunning hand
intertwine
diplomatic nonsense
and rule our destiny
funny of course peaceful warrior
and the epigram is the most evil
on the famous Christmastide he is worthy
but what a lovely and lively
war battle and fire
bloody and empty field
bivouac knight's strike
and what an enviable battle day
not too wise mustachioed
but the heart is a true hussar
they live in their tent
in the distance there is fun and bliss and grace
how to live immortal coward horace
into the dark forest of Tibur
not to know the light is a compulsion
not knowing that boredom is fear
give dinner and fight
sing and fight
happy who is sweet and scary world
oh who for song for deed
thunder true praise
who will praise mars and temir
and hang the lira
between the faithful saber and the saddle
but you are the enemy of labor and glory
pet phoebus and fun
you are a peaceful idle friend
whisper in your ear you are right
and I agree with you
God creates for himself nature
your paradise and happiness fool
slander man and fashion
of course for fun lady
care noble people
foolishness for everyone and we
solitude and freedom
only to scatter benevolent darkness
above us lies its quiet veil
and move the time towards midnight
arrow slow clock
when not to sleep in the silence of nature
one happy love
then my dungeon again
I leave the silent vault
volatile rest minute
I am too much of a loss
but soon argus will fall asleep
the castle is treacherous believe
and I am in your abode
my steps are swift
by voluptuous silence
by a bold trembling hand
with inflamed breathing
and hot, gentle lips
find out lover insist
delight my joy
oh lida if i were to die
with bliss, bliss and love
I'm dating the eighteenth spring
this is the last time I can be with you
thoughtfully listen to the noise of the oak grove
over the lake go hand in hand
where are you summer carelessness recent
with hope in bloom the young year
my dear friend we are entering a new world
but there we are not to assign equal shares
and our different ways leave a mark on life
you are the hand of fortune, capricious
to show the way, both happy and glorious
my path is sad and dark
and you give tender beauty
and I like the brilliant gift of nature
and a quick mind and a loyal sweet disposition
you create for sweet freedom
for joy for glory for fun
they come your golden year
fire love lovely time
hurry to love and happy yesterday
Today be happy again be careful
Amur, order tomorrow if possible
myrtle beauty to crown again
how many tears to foresee you are the culprit
cheating friend and fickle lover
be faithful to be captivated and to captivate
and my lot is but a cloudy fog
why should I hide the future
alas, I can't live forever, deception
and happiness is forgotten to embrace the shadow
my whole life is sad darkness bad weather
two or three spring baby can be
I am happy to be not to understand happiness
they pass but can they be forgotten
they pass and the sorrowful eye
look at the path leave forever
strew a flower on the short path
which I so happily flow through
I shed tears I waste my life in vain
painful desire grief
your dawn dawn spring beautiful
my my friend autumn dawn
I know love but not know hope
suffer alone in silence love
crazy dream leave languid eyelids
but I'm a gloomy dream, I can't forget
soul full involuntary sad thought
I seem to be at life's feast
I am a gloomy guest alone with longing to appear
to appear for an hour and die alone
and not to come friend of the heart unforgettable
at the last moment my languid gaze closes
and not come to the lonely hill
to sigh with love for the last time
Will my youth pass through the desert?
or am I a stranger happy love
Is it really possible to die without knowing what joy is?
Why should God give me life?
what should i wait in a row forget warrior
The singer gets lost among the crowd
what reward am I worthy of in the future
and what a crown of happiness to take
but what is there to be ashamed of, no murmur, humiliation
no righteous god definition
Is it only me who does not know the clear day?
no, even tears can hide the pleasure
and in this life I will be a consolation
my humble gift and happiness friend
pass love die desire
we separate the cold light
who remembers the secret date
dream delight previous year
allow the memory to appear in the sheet
they leave a minute trace
my friend is not famous, I am a poet
at least an Orthodox Christian
soul immortal word no
my verse is an unequal lot
and the song is a wayward muse
fun frisky young year
die death funny
and we will not touch the light here
ah know my good genius
what would i prefer soon
immortality my soul
immortality is your creation
We have no control over our fate
at least there is no doubt
this fruit is careless inspiration
without signature in your hand
on a modest piece of friendship
to escape from general oblivion
but let the work be in vain
your friendship is lively
let my poem die
voice heart feeling unchanging
They are probably worried
rush through a year of imprisonment
not long peaceful friend
we see shelter solitude
and the Tsarskoye Selo field
separation we wait at the threshold
we call high beam noise
and everyone looks at the road
with excitement proud young thought
another hides his mind under his shako
already in warlike attire
hussar's sabre wave
in the cool of the Epiphany morning
it's beautiful to freeze at the parade
and to warm up go to the guard
another to give birth to be a nobleman
It is not an honor but an honour to love
the rogue is a nobleman in the hallway
the humble rogue sees himself
I am the only one who obeys fate in everything
happy sloth faithful son
soul carefree indifferent
I quietly doze off alone
I am equal to the clerk Uhlan
equal law shako
I don't want to rush into captain's office
and don't crawl into the assessor
friend a little indulgence
leave the red cap
while he is for sinning
I wouldn't trade it for a bump
while lazy maybe
do not fear terrible trouble
still the hand is careless
open your vest in July
to ever look at this secret leaflet
I used to write
fly away to the lyceum corner for a while
almighty sweet dream
you remember quick minute first day
captivity peaceful six year connection
sadness joy dream your soul
quarrel friendship and sweetness reconciliation
what to be and not to be again
and with quiet melancholy tears
you remember your first love
my friend she pass but with the first friend
not a frisky dream to conclude your union
before the terrible time before the terrible fate
oh dear eternal he
for the last time in the silence of solitude
my verse listen to our penate
lyceum life dear brother
share with you the last moment
so they go through the summer connection
so he breaks our brotherly faithful circle
forgive keep secret sky
never part, dear friend
with fortune friendship and feb
to know love unknown me
love hope delight rapture
and your day is a dream of flight
yes fly into happy silence
forgive wherever I am in the fire or mortal battle
Is the native stream on the peaceful shore?
holy brotherhood faithful i
and may fate hear my prayer
let everyone be happy your whole friend
recently seduce lovely dream
I will shine in the crown, king, I will see myself
I dream of loving you
and the heart beats with pleasure
I am passionate about your feet in delight to explain
dream oh why don't you prolong happiness
but God is not everything I deprive now
I only want to lose the kingdom
you are sad to admit that you are
love my friend but who are you to captivate
She and who is it Chloe who is pouring glycerin
oh no who are you to sacrifice soul
ah she you are a humble dear friend
but why are you upsetting me so much?
and who is to blame, husband, father of course
not that my friend but what am I she not he
be in russia city lug
Petersburg district
It would be bad if it weren't for this
a small town on the sign
if only I had not been born
My Novorzhev
forgive faithful oak grove
forgive the careless world field
and light-winged fun
the day flies away so quickly
forgive trigorsky where is joy
I meet so many times
That's why I recognize your sweetness
to leave you forever
from you take the memory
and you leave your heart
be able sweet dream
I'm coming back to your field
come under the linden vault
on the slope of Trigorsky hill
fan friendly freedom
fun grace and intelligence
eagle from stomin to bed
to lie in wretched nakedness
not to be different in hot business
fickle general
don't think about hurting my dear
take lais microscope
and speak to let see
than you I my dear
Metropolitan is a shameless braggart
you send your fruit
we want to assure as we can see
that he himself is the god of his garden
maybe everything is possible you are Harita
smile decrepitude win
drive metropolitan crazy
and the ardor of desire in the mute to give birth
and he will meet your magical gaze
forget about your cross
and tenderly begin to sing a prayer service
your heavenly beauty
listen I'm a fairy tale you start
about igor and his wife
about novgorod and the golden kingdom
and maybe about the formidable king
and grandma starts an empty one
we will finish Ilya the hero
Turgenev faithful patron
priest jew and eunuch
but too happy a persecutor
and the Jesuit and the fool
and my laziness is fruitless
always carefree and free
girlfriend beneficial sleep
why should I laugh
when i am weak hand
to wander with trepidation on the lyre
and only a soft sound
love this dear heart torment
in the string unvoiced find
soul indulge in pleasure
I'm sweetly sweetly dozing off
only you with deep laziness
I want to combine work and desire
You alone are a passionate lover
and Solomirsky and the cross
then night jump with beautiful
then preach christ
for a wedding and in the Bible hall
among fun and care
drop lunin at the ball
raise a trembling orphan
sloth cute on parnassus
forget your love your sorrow
with a smile doze in Arzamas
and sleep at Count de Laval's
bear a painful burden
empty or heavy duty
you alone find time
laughing is my laziness
don't call me you're sick
to leave work forever
nor to poetic bondage
no need to process the verse
what is the need if and with error
and sometimes it's hard to sing
let there be only a smile
love my carefree
inflame and calm
and the work is cold and empty
a poem is never worth it
smile voluptuous lips
don't ask why you're thinking so sadly
among the fun I often darken
why raise a sullen gaze at everything
why am i not cute sweet life dream
don't ask why the soul has cooled down
I fall out of love cheerful love
and no one calls me cute
whoever loves once will never love again
who knows happiness will never know happiness
for a brief moment we give bliss
from youth from bliss and voluptuousness
to remain despondently alone
alien land inexperienced amateur
and his usual accuser
I speak in my fatherland
where is the true mind where is the genius we find
where is the citizen with a noble soul
sublime and fiery free
where a woman is not with cold beauty
but with a fiery captivating live
where to find a casual conversation
brilliant cheerful enlightened
with whom can you be not cold not empty
I almost hate my fatherland
but I saw Gallitsyn yesterday
and reconcile with my fatherland
in sad idleness I forget the lyre
imagination does not flare up in a dream
with the gift of youth my genius fly away
and the heart slowly grows cold and closes
you again I call on my day spring
you fly under the canopy of silence
day friendship love hope and sadness tender
when poetry is a serene admirer
I sing quietly on the lyre happy
excitement love despondency separation
and the oak grove mountain transmits the hum
my thoughtful sound
In vain do I drag the shameful burden of laziness
to fall into a cold drowsiness involuntarily
run from joy run from dear muse
and a tear in the eye with the glory of saying goodbye
but suddenly like a lightning arrow
to light up youth in a withered heart
soul wake up come to life
to discover again love hope sorrow and joy
everything will blossom again and life will tremble
nature is once again an ecstatic witness
alive feel breathe freely
to captivate virtue greatly
praise love praise god
again the lyre sweet the voice of the youth is heard
and with a ringing tremor the string will rise again
carry to your feet
run hide from the eye
cythera weak queen
where are you where are you thunder king
freedom proud singer
come and pick a wreath from me
to break the effeminate lyre
want to sing freedom peace
to strike vice on the throne
I open a noble trail
that exalted Gaul
who is the glorious one in the midst of trouble
you are a bold anthem to inspire
pet windy fate
tyrant world tremble
and you take courage and pay attention
rise up fallen slave
alas, wherever you look
everywhere a scourge everywhere iron
law is a deadly disgrace
bondage feeble tear
Everywhere there is unjust power
in thicken the darkness of prejudice
sit slavery formidable genius
and the glory of fatal passion
only there above the king's head
people do not lie down suffering
where the holy freedom is strong
law powerful combination
where all they spread out a solid shield
where to reap the faithful hand
citizen above equal head
they are a sword without a choice to slide
and a crime with high
fight with righteous force
where their hand is not bribed
neither greedy nor stingy nor fear
Lord, you are the crown and throne
give the law and not nature
stand tall you people
but the eternal law is above you
and woe to the woe tribe
where he sleeps carelessly
where are the people or the king
the law to rule is possible
you call as a witness
O martyr, glorious error
for the ancestor in the noise of the recent storm
to compose the royal chapter
ascend to death louis
in the form of silent offspring
chapter debunk penetrate
to the bloody chopping block treachery
keep quiet law people keep quiet
mouth criminal axe
and behold the villainous purple
lying chained on the Gauls
autocratic villain
you your throne i hate
your doom death child
with cruel joy to see
read on your forehead
seal curse people
you horror world shame nature
reproach you god on earth
when on the gloomy Neva
midnight star sparkle
and a carefree chapter
to burden a peaceful sleep
look at the thoughtful singer
to sleep menacingly in the fog
desert monument tyrant
oblivion abandon palace
and hear the terrible voice of Kliya
behind this terrible wall
caligulla last hour
he sees vividly before the eye
he see in ribbon and star
wine and anger intoxicated
go killer hidden
on the face there is insolence, in the heart there is fear
keep silent wrong sentry
lower the drawbridge silently
gates open to the darkness of night
hand betrayal hired
oh shame oh horror our day
like a beast invade janissaries
mouth inglorious blow
perish crown villain
and today learn about the king
neither punishment nor reward
neither blood nor dungeon nor altar
not true for you fence
bow first chapter
under the canopy of a reliable law
and become the eternal guardian of the throne
people freedom and peace
don't threaten young sloth
untimely death I do not expect
in a wreath of love for the shelter of the grave
don't think about anything without timidity get off go
I live little, I enjoy little
but sometimes it's fun to pick a flower
I see life only as the beginning
Don't scare us, we are a dear friend
coffin close housewarming
We are really so idle
I have no time to do anything
let the cooled life cup
pull slowly the other
We are losing our youth
together with life dear
each to his own tomb
we sit down on the threshold
the queen of Paphos
fresh beg for a wreath
extra moment is true laziness
circular pouring vessel
and the crowd is our shadow
to the quiet summer to run away
our mortal moment must be bright
and a naughty friend
they collect light ashes
in the urn an idle feast
Licinia do you see the fast chariot
crown the laurel in brilliant purple
arrogant to fall apart vetuli young
in the crowd of people fly along the pavement
watch as everyone before him humbly bows his back
watch as the lictor drives away the unfortunate people
flatterer senator beauty long row
he followed with a zealous gaze, touchingly
wait catch with trepidation smile eye movement
as if a wonderful god was blessing
and a small child and an old man with gray hair
all prostrate themselves before the idol, silently fall into the dust
for they and the trace of the wheel to imprint in the mud
to be some kind of honorable and sacred monument
O Romulan people, say how long have you fallen?
who are you to enslave and power to fetter
Quirite proudly bows down under the yoke
who is to be enslaved by heaven
should I say, my homeland, Vetulia, shame on me
depraved youth sit in council husband
favorite despot senate weak rule
to spread the yoke over Rome to dishonor the fatherland
vetulius roman king about shame about time
or the universe is devoted to destruction
but who under the portico with the head bowed
in tear the cloak with a walking stick
through the noisy crowd frowning to go
where are you going our wise friend the truth will give
where not to know myself long ago to be silent and see
I will leave Rome forever I hate slavery
licinia good friend isn't it good and we
humbly bow fortune and dream
gray-haired cynic example learn
Isn't it good to say goodbye to this depraved city?
where everything is corrupt law is right
and consul and tribune and honor and beauty
Let the glycerine beauty be young
equally all is common as a circular cup
inexperience of another in hiring to catch the net
we are ashamed to have weakness with wrinkles
vain youth leave shine joy
let the shameless cleetus servant nobleman Cornelius
trade meanness and with a bold brow
from noble to rich crawl from house to house
I am a Roman heart boiling in my chest freedom
I do not sleep, the spirit of the great people
licinia hurry away from care
crazy sage deceptive beauty
envious fate in soul despise blow
to the village to transfer the paternal lari
in the cool ancient grove on the seashore
It is not difficult to find a secluded, bright house
where there is no longer any fear of popular unrest
in old age to rest in the wilderness solitude
and settle down in a cozy corner there
when the fiery oak is raised into the fireplace
remember the old man for his grandfather's filament
to inflame his spirit cruel juvenile
in satire to depict righteous vice
and this century's character is to expose posterity
o Rome o proud land debauchery crime
come terrible day day revenge punishment
to foresee the terrible greatness of the end
fall fall into dust universe crown
people young son fierce battle
with a sword on you to raise a powerful hand
and to leave both the mountain and the sea for oneself
and gush on you boil river
disappear rome he cover deep darkness
and the traveler directs his eye to the pile of stones
exclaim in deep gloomy thought
freedom of Rome will grow and slavery will be destroyed
I'm not that passionate lover
who will marvel first at the light
my spring and summer red
to pass forever, disappear without a trace
cupid god age young
I will be your faithful servant
ah if only I could be born again
Would I really serve you like that?
where is our rose
my friend
wither the rose
child of dawn
don't talk
so youth fades
don't talk
here is life joy
flower say
forgive regret
and on the lily
we indicate
all in a mysterious silence
hill dress darkness
walk in the cloudy glow
young crescent moon
see lyre over grave
doze in sweet silence
only time the mournful ringing
like laziness sweet voice
in the dead one can hear a string
see turtledove on lyre
in the rose cup and crown
friend here rest in peace
lust sage
look at the porphyry
he revives the cutter
here he is looking in the mirror
I say I am grey and old
life is to be given and enjoyed
life, alas, is not an eternal gift
here raise your hand on the lyre
and it is important to frown
want to sing he is god of war
but to sing one love
nature is getting ready here
pay the last debt
the old man dances in a circle
thirst to ask to quench
gray-haired lover all around
maiden jumping and singing
he is stingy with time
steal a few minutes
here is the muse and the charita
take your favorite to the grave
ivy rose twine
game after he go
he disappears like pleasure
like a happy dream love
your mortal age is a ghost
happiness is frisky to catch
enjoy enjoy
often pour a cup
passion ardent to tire
and rest for the cup
Can you hear the voice of the night beyond the grove?
singer love singer his sadness
when the field is silent in the morning hour
the flute sound is dull and simple
can you hear
Will you meet me in the deserted darkness of the forest?
singer love singer his sadness
trace or to come off or to notice a smile
or a quiet gaze to fill with melancholy
meet you
Should you sigh or listen to the quiet voice
singer love singer his sadness
when you go to the forest you are a young man, you see
meet the gaze of his dull eye
should you sigh?
Morpheus until the morning give joy
my painful love
come blow out my lamp
my dream is to bless
hide from memory the sad
separation is a terrible sentence
let me see your sweet gaze
let me hear my dear voice
when will the night's darkness rush away
and you are mine to leave the eye
oh if only the soul could
forget love until new night
God, you still have to give

and the languid maiden rushes

Saint Bacchus I am sober among friends
it used to be that wine sang water poem
dreamy dorida and praise and scold
or friendship to weave a wreath and friendship to yawn
and to sing a sleepy verse in the drowsiness
but how long will i cherish apollo
soul bored parnassian fun
I don't dream for long, I dream of the muse and glory
and strict experience involuntarily awakens
fall asleep between roses and thorns I wake up

everything is time everything is in its moment
funny and frivolous old man
funny and sedate young man
while we live we live
walk in my memory
pray and bacchus and love
and the mob despises the jealous murmuring
She doesn't know that it is possible to live in harmony
with a cypher with a portico and with a book and with a glass
that a high mind can be hidden
crazy prank under a light blanket
love friendship and laziness
sheltered from care and trouble
live under their reliable shadow
in solitude you are happy you are a poet
confidant god not scary storm evil
above he they have a high and holy providence
he lulls the young stone
and with a finger on his lips to keep his peace

and secretly show the way
I am a lyre sound of pleasure
baby to feel be able
and the lyre becomes my destiny
but where are you minute rapture
inexplicable heart heat
animated work and tearful inspiration
like smoke disappear my light gift
how early to attract envy I bloody gaze
and evil slander invisible dagger

forget my dear muse tormentor
but one can sigh in silent delight
listen to the sound of your string
what a delightful life
war battle and fire
bloody and empty field
bivouac knight's strike
and what an enviable short day
not too wise mustachioed
but the heart is a true hussar
they live in their tent
in the distance there is fun and bliss and grace
how to live immortal coward horace
into the dark forest of Tibur
not to know the light is a compulsion
not knowing that boredom is fear
give dinner and fight
sing and fight
happy who is sweet and scary world
oh who for song for deed
thunder true praise
who will praise mars and temir
and hang the lira
between the faithful saber and the saddle
for the last time in the canopy solitude
my verse listen to our penate
lyceum life dear brother
share with you the last moment
pass summer connection

to know love unknown me
love hope delight rapture
and your day is a dream of flight
yes fly into happy silence
forgive wherever I am in the fire or mortal battle
Is the native stream on the peaceful shore?
holy brotherhood faithful i
and may fate hear my prayer
let everyone be happy your whole friend
where does the wonderful noise of the frantic clamor come from?
who to call where and tambourine and timbrel
what does joyful face mean
and the song of the villager
in their bright circle freedom

but the crowd of people will move
he is approaching here he is a strong god
here is Bacchus, peaceful and eternally young
here he is, India's hero
oh joy you are full
tremble ready to strike string
not hypocritical praise

and in the heart to hide a quiet despondency
believe not love you are an inexperienced dreamer
oh if you were a sad feeling seeker
comprehend the terrible madness of love
when all her poison would boil into your blood
when in the long hour of a sleepless night
on the bed slowly tormented by melancholy

to close the sorrowful eye in vain
cover hot cry hug
and dry up in rage fruitless desire

I love enough to give away my peace
but gloomy love and unforgettable image
I wish I could stay with you forever
on lira modest noble
I do not praise the earthly god
and strength in pride free
censer flattery not to incense
freedom only glorifies fate
verse sacrifice only she
I don't give birth to the king to amuse
my shy muse
but to confess under helicon
where the Castalian current makes noise
I am an inspired Apollo

and I hear that God's light
united friendship beautiful
that without her there is no joy
that life would be a terrible way for us
if it weren't for the quiet light of friendship
but listening to the feeling of being different
it is both undead and tormenting
in work there is care and in rest
always be awake and burning
it is excruciatingly cruel
it's all soul in us to kill
if the ulcer is severe and deep
spruce hope not to live
this is the passion that I burn
I wither die in bloom year
but do not want to be healed
how sweet but god how dangerous

and in friendship you can draw sweet joy
boredom life languish vanity
I long to be close to you, my gentle friend, to rest
you remember our dear dawn year
baby we love to be able
how to fly away quickly
 
into a strange circle into an unkind side
I live little and enjoy little
and my sad day is the beginning
I've been bored for a long time, I've been fed up
to what I life I do not give birth for happiness
for joy for friendship for fun avoid
I drink coldly from the cup of voluptuousness
Dorida likes the golden curl
and a pale face and blue eyes
yesterday my friend left the feast at night
in her embrace I drink bliss soul
delight fast delight change
the desire to suddenly go out and flare up again
I melt but among the unfaithful darkness
another cute I see the devil
and all I am full of being mysterious sadness
and my lips whisper a strange name
I'm eluding the doctors
skinny shave but alive
his tormenting paw
I don't need to be burdened
health easy friend priapus
and sleep and sweet peace
as before to visit again
my corner is cramped and simple
to console and you are half-sick
he is eager to see you
you are a happy lawless person
lazy faggot citizen
freedom bacchus faithful son
venus devout worshiper
and the pleasure of the ruler
from the vanity of the capital idle
from cool charm neva
from harmful gossip rumor
from boredom so diverse
I call the hill meadow
shady maple garden
deserted river bank
and village freedom
give hand i come i
to the beginning gloomy September
with you drink we will be again
open heart speak
about the fool the evil nobleman
about the slave's registered
about the heavenly king
and sometimes about the earthly
oh you who combine
with soul passionate frank
although a Russian general
courtesy enlightened mind
oh you who with every day
get up on military flour
tired mustachioed man on horseback
teach king science
but do not dishonor in the heat of the moment
your warlike hand
despicable stick executioner
eagle you are right i forget
your hussar dream
and with Solomon to exclaim
uniform and saber vanity
on General Kiselev
don't put your hope in
he is very sweet, that's not a word
he is an enemy of deceit and ignorance
for a noisy slow lunch
I'm glad to sit next to him
He is happy to listen until the night
but he is a courtier promise
he is not worth anything
to pacify unpeaceful desire
without doliman without mustache
hide with secret freedom
bliss and nature
under the canopy of grandfather's forest
over the lake in a quiet hut
or in the grass of a thick meadow
or a hill on a green slope
in a Bukhara hat and robe
I will sing my god
and be waiting for when to rise
with a bed rest god sword
and the loud challenge to burst forth
then leave the world field
pet flame bellon
the throne has a loyal citizen
eagle I stand under the banner
your warlike squad
in the tent amidst the battle amidst the fire
with a sword and a lyre fighting
to be cut off to be in front of you
and glory to sing your blow
life is that dear friend
who is stupid and not sick
who has no time to fall in love
who takes everything and is happy with everything
who's got a nadinka for the evening
to caress for the secret dinner
and the fat Strasbourg pie
wine fragrant to wash down
who remove care away
like a faithful son of Paphos, Vera
see off the devout night
with a young nun citera
in the morning he sleeps sweetly
read leaflet disabled
dedicate the whole day to fun
and at night the cypris will reign again
and don't we lead the day like that?
Shcherbinin frisky friend fun
with cupid prank wine
still young and healthy
but the young day will fly by
we leave joy and bliss
desire to change feelings
the heart will dry up and grow cold
then without a song without a friend
without pleasure without desire
find joy dear friend
into a foggy dream a memory
then shake your head
say you're at the door coffin
do you remember fanny my dear
and both smile quietly
greet you deserted corner
shelter peace work and inspiration
where does my invisible stream flow day
to the bosom of happiness and oblivion
I am yours I exchange the vicious court of Circe
sumptuous feast fun delusion
to the peaceful noise of the oak grove to the silence of the field
on idleness free girlfriend reflection
I love yours this dark garden
with its coolness and flower
this meadow is filled with fragrant haystacks
where the bright stream rustles in the bushes
everywhere in front of me there is a moving picture
here see two lakes azure plain
where the fisherman's sail sometimes turns white
behind them there is a row of hills and a striped field
scatter the hut in the distance
a herd wanders along the wet shore
smoky barn and mill krilat
everywhere there is a trace of contentment and work
I am here to free myself from the shackles of vanity
I learn to find bliss in truth
free soul law worship
grumbling not to listen crowd unenlightened
participation answer shy plea
and not to envy fate
a villain or a fool in greatness is wrong
oracle century here to ask you
in solitude majestic
your joyful voice is heard
he drives away laziness gloomy sleep
to work to generate heat in me
and your creative thought
to see the depth of the soul
but the thought is terrible here to darken the soul
among the flowering fields and mountains
friend humanity is sad to notice
everywhere ignorance is a deadly disgrace
don't see don't listen moan
the chosen man is destined for destruction
here the lordship is wild without feeling without law
to appropriate oneself violent vine
and labor and property and time farmer
leaning on an alien plow to submit to the scourge
here slavery skinny drag along the reins
the implacable owner
here the heavy yoke will drag you to the grave
hope and inclination in the soul to nourish not dare
here the young maiden blossoms
for whim unfeeling villain
support dear old father
young son comrade labor
from the hut native go to multiply yourself
courtyard crowd exhausted slave
oh if only my voice could disturb the heart
why does a fruitless heat burn in my chest
and I will not give fate the formidable gift of rhetoric
to see, oh friend, a people not oppressed
and slavery fallen by mania king
and over the fatherland freedom enlightened
Will the beautiful dawn finally rise?
no no your penalty is in vain
I love you still the same
day our dear friend
run like a morning shadow
like water a fast stream
how long has the secret fate been
we serve life as a cup
yet for us she is full
to its edge to cling lips
we drink delight and love
for us hope pleasure
 
as a new delusion
we enjoy blooming
but the memory is to be revived
but the heart is in a quiet sleep
in the past love to forget
estate peaceful invisible patron
you pray my good brownie
keep the village forest and my wild garden
and a humble family is my abode
yes do not harm field dangerous cold rain
and the wind late autumn raid
yes, in time of beneficial snow
cover the field with wet fertilizer
remain a secret guard in the hereditary canopy
comprehend timidity midnight thief
and from an unfriendly gaze
happy house guard
walk around his caring guard
love my little garden and the sleepy shore water
and this secluded garden
with gate dilapidated with collapse fence
love green slope hill
meadow trample my wander laziness
coolness linden and maple noisy roof
they are familiar inspiration
Great, Yuryev, birthday boy
great Yuryev Leib-Ulan
today for you the hermit
drain a foamy glass
Great, Yuryev, birthday boy
great Yuryev Leib-Ulan
great knight dashing
love freedom and wine
for we are an ally of the young
hope lamp light
great knight dashing
love freedom and wine
great youth and happiness
drinking cup and brothel
where with loud laughter voluptuousness
we lead the drunk to bed
good youth and happiness
drinking cup and brothel
above the lake in the deep oak grove
no time to save yourself monk
always in a stern occupation
prayer and work during Lent
already the shoulder blade is humble
old man dig his own grave
and only about death desired
saint to pray
one day summer is at the door
droop your hut
anchorite praying to god
the oak grove becomes black
fog over the lake smokes
and the red moon in the cloud
roll quietly through the sky
the monk begins to look at the water
I can't help but look at it with complete fear
not being able to understand oneself
and see the wave boiling
and suddenly calm down again
and suddenly light as a shadow of the night
white as early snow hill
a woman goes out naked
and silently sit down at the shore
look at the old monk
and scratching wet hair
holy monk trembling with fear
and look at her beauty
she beckons it hand
nod head quickly
and suddenly a shooting star
the wave hid under the sleepy one
the old man is gloomy and can't sleep all night
and not pray all day
in front of myself with an involuntary thought
all see wonderful maiden shadow
oak grove again dress darkness
go on cloud moon
and again the maiden over the water
sit lovely and pale
look nod head
kiss from give jokingly
play splash wave
laugh cry like a child
call monk tenderly moan
monk monk ko ya ko ya
and suddenly in a wave transparent drown
and all in deep silence
on the third day the passionate hermit
near the enchanted shore
sit and wait for the beautiful girl
and the shadow falls among the oak grove
the dawn drives away the darkness of the night
monk not to be found anywhere
and only the beard is gray
boy see in water
whose thought is delight to guess
comprehend the mystery of beauty
whose brush on the sky means
this heavenly devil
you are a genius but love is suffering
he strikes the gaze dumb
he focused on his creation
and the fiery soul goes out
blessed is he who is in the distant shadow
far away a demanding ignoramus
divide the day between work and laziness
memory and hope
who is fate sending a friend
who hide by the grace of the creator
from the sleeper fool
from awakener impudent
I love the evening feast
where is the fun chairman
and freedom is my idol
to the legislator's table
where to drink the word until the morning
drown out the scream song
where the spacious circle is a guest
and the bottle circle is tight
forgive happy son feast
spoiled child freedom
so from our shore
from dead area slave
corporal whim and fashion
you jump to peaceful moscow
where is the pleasure to know the price
doze off carefree in waking
and in life there is a change to love
varied and lively
moscow captivate diversity
ancient luxury feast
bride bell
funny easy fuss
innocent prose and verse
are you there for a noisy evening
see important idleness
affectation in fine lace
and stupidity in golden glasses
and heavy nobility joy
and boredom with a card in hand
just a minute observer
you laugh under your arm
but soon a faithful admirer
fun and golden laziness
following my advice
and the will of the whole soul to love
leave a circle of great light
and decide to live for yourself
already to move to the shelter
I see you in my mind
boil in a glass foam
ai cold stream
in thick smoke lazy pipe
a new friend in a robe
make noise and drink a cheerful cup
go around their crazy circle
and rush into joyful leisure
and there is an Egyptian maiden
fly swirl before you
I hear a ringing chant
groan bliss scream wild howl
their frantic movement
fire furious eye
and everything is my friend in your soul
to give birth to awe and rapture
but remember the dear one here alone
you expect it all the time
sigh captive young
the whole day is dull and languid
in his sweet thoughtfulness
cry quietly under the window
from the terrible argus stealthily
and look at the deserted house
where we so often feast
from Cypris Bacchus and you
where with hope and longing
her desire to fly away
oh will you soon find your darling
she lowered her gaze
and fall before love
lock jealous bolt
and our orphaned circle
Comrade, will you soon come to life?
when to jump dear friend
the soul strives to follow you
wherever you are, take the wreath
from the hand of the young voluptuousness
and prove that you are an expert
into the unknown science happiness
there is a valley near the forest
where the flow of light stream is joyful
young edwin says goodbye there with alina
I hear their last kiss
rise moon alina sit there
and it is hard for her to breathe
rise dawn alina all look
through the white steam onto the deserted path
there by the stream under the willow farewell
the neighboring one has a shepherd, she apparently
when the stream is sad
in the midday heat he calls the herd
it's already half a year since I've been here
and I see Edwin walking in the distance
he goes to be sad to the oak grove along the valley
where the flow of light water is cheerful
look edwin under the willow where with darling
he says goodbye, he stands, holy monk
place a cross over a new grave
and on the cross a withered rose crown
and in a dumb soul suddenly shy from fear
who is here to hide read the inscription he
head droop fall to foot monk
and I hear his last groan
everything is a ghost of vanity
everything is crap and nastiness
glass and beauty
here is life joy
love and wine
we are the right equal
without them they are a person
I could yawn forever
they are too lazy to add more
laziness and they are at the same time
I praise love with her
she and I pour wine
I know Lidinka is my friend
who is sweet in thoughtfulness
you devote your leisure time
who are you to sacrifice secretly
from suspicious girlfriend
you scare the prankster dear
light-winged charmer
and his cold importance
you are an unbearable hymen
you pray to another god
your fate to conquer
tender delight to you
find a deserted road
I understand the weak heat of the eye
I understand the half-closed gaze
and the cheeks turn pale
and the languor of your gait
your god is not a complete joy
give your fan
his mysterious reward
young modesty to cherish
he loves sleep imagination
he tolerates the lock on the door
he is a bashful friend pleasure
he is a brother love but lonely
when insomnia sad
you languish in the darkness of the night
he revives the secret power
your vague dream
sigh tenderly with poor Lida
and drive quiet hand
and to inspire sleep with cyprida
and sweet virginal peace
in solitary pleasure
you think deceive love
in vain in the very rapture
sigh and languish again
Cupid, won't you come and look?
to his unhallowed shelter
your beauty is like a rose fading
minute youth run
Is my prayer in vain?
forget criminal dream
You won't be beautiful forever
You are beautiful not for yourself

I rush there with excitement and longing
to intoxicate with memory
and feel a tear being born in the eye again
the soul boils and freezes

I remember the previous year crazy love
and all that I suffer and all that the heart loves
desire and hope are a languid deception
make noise make noise obedient sail
worry under the gloomy ocean
fly ship carry me to the distant limit
by the terrible whim of the deceptive sea
but not to the sad shore
my foggy homeland
a country where passion burns

and the cold heart betrays suffering

how pure love prayer ascend
stare like crazy at the black shawl
and the cold soul is tormented by sadness
when gullible and young i am
young greek woman i passionately love
lovely maiden caress me
but soon I will live to see a rainy day
one day i invite a merry guest
who knocked on my door, despicable Jew
with you feast whisper he friend
You're cheating on your Greek woman
I give him gold and curse him
and call my faithful servant
we go out I rush on a fast horse
and the meek pity to be silent in me
I barely saw the Greek woman's threshold
my eyes go dark I'm completely exhausted
I alone enter the distant chamber
unfaithful virgin kiss armenian
I will not see the light of the damask steel thundering
interrupt kiss villain not have time
headless body i trample for a long time
and silently look at the maiden turning pale
I remember the prayer flowing blood
die greek woman die love
with her head dead take off the black shawl
I silently wipe away the bloody steel
my slave as the evening mist sets in
into the Danube wave throw their body
Since then I have not kissed the lovely eye
since then I don't know happy night
stare like crazy at the black shawl
and the cold soul is tormented by sadness
havronios the scolder inveterate
into darkness into dust into contempt gray-haired
calm down buddy what is the magazine noise
and the lampoon of languid stupidity
joker evil with smile say stupidity
ignoramus stupid yawn say mind
into life gloomy and despicable
it will take him a long time to sink
long the whole end of the universe
he defiles debauchery
but to improve little by little
he is making amends for his shame
and now he is, thank God
just a card thief
among green will kiss tavrida
at dawn I see a nereid
hidden between the trees I barely dare to breathe
over clear moisture demigoddess breast
young white as a swan to rise
and squeeze foam from hair
thin cloud flying ridge
star sad evening star
your ray silvers the withered plain
and doze the bay and the black rock top
love your weak light in the heavenly heights
he thought to wake up to sleep in me
I remember your sunrise, familiar luminary
above a peaceful country where everything is dear to the heart
where the slender poplar rises in the valley
where the tender myrtle and dark cypress slumber
and the midday wave sweetly makes noise
there is no time in the mountain the heart is full of thoughts
I drag out my thoughtful laziness over the sea
when the night shadow goes to the hut
and the young maiden in the darkness you seek
and call your friend's name
Prince GSO I am not familiar
I don't see such a bad mixture
it consists of meanness and arrogance
but meanness is a lot of arrogance in the dumb
in battle a coward in a tavern he is a barge hauler
in the hall he's a scoundrel in the living room he's a fool
when the sea is blue
marshmallows glide and quietly wink
the proud ship is at sail
and the boat on the waves to cherish
care and thought are a heavy burden
then being lazy is fun for me
and forget the song muse
I am the sea sweet noise cute
when will the wave hit the shore
roar boil and foam splash
and thunder rumbles across the sky
and lightning will shine in the darkness
I move away from the sea
in the hospitable oak grove
earth i seem right
and I am a miserable, harsh fisherman
live on a frail boat
play blind abyss
and I am in reliable silence
listen to the noise of the stream valley
in my infancy she I loved
and I will hand over the seven-barreled trumpet
she listened to me with a smile and slightly
by the ringing well empty reed
I'm already too weak to play
and the hymn is important to inspire God
and the song of the peaceful Phrygian shepherd
from morning till evening in the silent shadow of the oak
I diligently listen to the lesson of the secret maiden
and to please I am a random reward
brush a lock of hair from a cute forehead
she takes the flute from my hand
reed be revive divine breath
and fill the heart with holy charm
I experience my desire
I fall out of love with my dream
being alone is suffering
fruit of the heart emptiness
under the storm fate is cruel
my blooming crown will fade
live sad lonely
and wait for my end to come
so late cold strike
like a storm, the winter whistle is audible
one on the branch naked
tremble belated leaf
war finally rise
rustle banners battle honor
see blood see holiday revenge
whistle around me the destructive lead
and how strong the impression is
for my soul to thirst
aspiration stormy militia
alarm station sound sword
and into the fatal fire of battle
fall of the warrior and the leader
proud subject chant
wake up my sleeping genius
everything is new to be I am a simple canopy tent
fire enemy they alien call
evening drum thunder cannon screech core
and death is a terrible expectation
were you born into me blind glory passion
you thirst death fierce heat hero
wreath am I double to get on part
the end or the dark judge I lot fight
and all die with me hope young day
sacred heart heat to high aspiration
memory and brother and friend
and the thought of creative vain excitement
and you and you love is not a swearing noise
neither military labor nor proud murmuring glory
nothing can drown out my usual thoughts
I conceal the victim of evil poison
peace run i no power over myself
and the soul is overcome by a painful laziness
why delay the horror of battle
Well, the battle hasn't started yet
friend delvig my parnassian brother
yours i prose be console
but I confess, baron, I am a sinner
verse I would be very glad
you know yourself in a minute
I am on the shore of Parnassus water

there was something to write about
everything smells like Rus' to another

That's all Timkovsky gasps
now I can barely breathe
from abstinence the muse languishes
and rarely rarely with she sins
to the unfaithful glory I grow cold
and by habit only one
lazily dragging after her
as a husband for a proud wife
I will forget her vow
one freedom is my idol
but still love my poet

so definitely forget today

in the country where yulia will get married
and drive out the cunning August

where is the elegiac lyre

he is cowardly to dedicate

but there is no friendship with me I am sad to see
azure alien sky midday edge
neither muse nor work nor joy leisure
nothing can replace a single friend
you are my healer my spiritual strength
oh constant friend you i dedicate
and fate will already test its short life
and the feeling of being able to save you
you know my heart in the bloom of a young day
you see how then in excitement passion
I secretly languish, a weary sufferer
in a minute death over the abyss hidden
you support me i am a sleepless hand
you are a friend who replaces hope and peace
to penetrate into the depths of the soul with a stern gaze
you revive she advice or reproach
your heat ignite to high love
patience brave in i am born again
I can't offend the voice of slander
to be able to despise to be able to hate
that I need to be in the solemn court
serf noble ignoramus at the star
or the philosopher who in the previous summer
debauchery amaze four part light
but to enlighten yourself to atone for your shame
wean off wine and become a card thief
speaker luzhniki nobody notice
I am little annoyed by my harmless bark
Should I complain about the naughty fellow?
about babbling to give zoilus and fool
and gossip to disassemble playful undertaking
when can i be proud of your friendship
thank god i pass the dark path
Early sorrow presses upon my chest
I get used to sadness I settle accounts with fate
and life to endure the stoic soul
one desire to stay you with me
I do not torment the sky with another prayer
oh my friend is it soon time for separation
when to connect the word love and hand
when I hear your heartfelt greetings
how to hug you see the office
where you are always a sage and sometimes a dreamer
and the windy crowd is a dispassionate observer
come come I am my dear homebody again
with you remember the conversation last year
young evening prophetic dispute
familiar dead man live conversation
argue reread judge scold
freedom-loving hope to revive
and I am happy to be but only for God's sake
drive you sheping from our doorstep
who sees the edge where luxury nature
revive the oak grove and meadow
where the water makes noise and sparkles joyfully
and caress the peaceful shore
where on the hill under the laurel vault
don't dare to lie down gloomy snow
say I who see the lovely land
where i love exile unknown
Golden Limit Elvin's Favorite Land
to you to fly is my desire
I remember the cliff coastal rapids
I remember water cheerful stream
and shadow and noise and red valley
where in silence a simple Tatar family
among care and with mutual friendship
under the roof live hospitable
everything is alive there everything is there the eye is a joy
garden tatar village city
reflect wave rock bulk
a ship gets lost in the sea distance
amber hanging on vine grapes
b meadow rustle wander herd
and see the swimmer grave mithridates
illuminate the sunset with radiance
and where the myrtle rustles over the fallen urn
to see again through the dark forest
and the vault of the rock and the sea's azure shine
and clear as joy the sky
Will the excitement subside? Life is stormy
minute year to resurrect beauty
to come again under the sweet shade
soul fall asleep on the bosom peaceful laziness
gape from mass
to go to the house to katakazi

recently a poor Muslim

to follow the hive behind the herd
and for home-grown grapes
not knowing what laziness is

my dear, sweet, handsome friend
I can't get even a tiny piece of kaymak
mehmet to get soft to get ready to tie up
in a sash a tin plate
child bless wife kiss
and a moment to run to the nearest valley
to please the patient
he won't walk but will fly back
to go down the mountain to barely walk
and soon the search becomes completely exhausting
a place to relax
luckily at the end of the valley
he sees the stream
to wander to the shore and lie down in the shade of a branch
murmur water tree top
fragrant grass cool shore
and shade and a light breeze
all undead all talk
to love or to rest to love is such an undertaking
Mehmet doesn't come to mind
although he can sleep, he's cute
wisely and correctly

Ovid I live near a quiet shore
which the paternal god expels
you have no time to bring and leave your ashes
your joyless crying this place to glorify
and the lyre's gentle voice is not yet dumb
your rumor still fills this limit
you vividly impress my imagination
desert dark poet imprisonment
foggy vault sky ordinary snow
and short warmth warm the meadow
how often to captivate a dull string game
I heart follow Ovid for you
I see your ship play shaft
and the anchor dropped near the wild shore
where to wait singer love cruel reward
there is a field without a shadow, a hill without grapes
give birth in snow for horror war
there is the cold, fierce son of Scythia
for the ist er s t t o s t t o s t o s t a t ...
and the village threatens a raid every moment
there is no obstacle for them in the wave they swim
and walk fearlessly on the sonorous ice
you yourself are amazed nazon are amazed fate is perverse
you from a young age despise the excitement of military life
get used to rose crown your hair
and spend carefree hours in bliss
you will be forced to put on a heavy helmet
and keep the formidable sword near the timid lyre
neither daughter nor wife nor faithful friend
neither muse easy friend former day
to drive away the singer not to sweeten the sorrow
in vain grace crown your verse
In vain, young man, do they remember by heart
neither glory nor year nor complaint nor sadness
no song can touch the timid octavia
the day of your old age will sink into oblivion
golden italy luxury citizen
in the fatherland the barbarian is unknown and alone
you don't hear the sound of homeland around you
you in grave grief distant friendship write
oh return i holy city father
and the shadow of the peaceful ancestral garden
oh friend august my prayer to bear
punish hand tear reject
but if the angry god is still inexorable
and I will never see you, great Rome
the last plea to soften the terrible fate
bring at least my coffin closer to Italy beautiful
whose heart is cold to despise the harith
your despondency and tears reproach
who in rude pride read without affection
this elegy is the last creation
where do you pass on your futile groan to your offspring
I am a stern Slav, I will not get off, I will not spill
but to understand they are a self-willed exile
and the light and myself and life are dissatisfied
with a thoughtful soul I now visit
a country where you have no time to drag out a sad life
here you revive your dream imagination
I repeat your Ovidian hymn
and their sad picture to verify
but the gaze deceives the dream to change
exile your captivate in the mystery of the eye
get used to snow gloomy midnight
here the azure sky shines for a long time
here briefly reigns the cruelty of the winter storm
a new settler to the Scythian coast
son south grapes shine purple
already cloudy December on the Russian meadow
spread a layer of fluffy snow
winter breathes there and with spring warmth
here the sun is clear I have to roll
the withered meadow is variegated with young greenery
free field to plow already early plow
a slight breeze blows in the evening it gets cold
barely transparent ice over the lake grows dim
crystal cover motionless jet
I remember your timid experience
this day notice winged inspiration
when you first entrust with bewilderment
step your wave fetter winter
and new ice seems to appear before me
your shadow slides and your plaintive sound
to be heard from afar like a languid groan of separation
console yourself not to fade Ovid's crown
alas, the singer got lost among the crowd
I am unknown to the new generation
and the victim dark die my weak genius
with sad life with minute rumor
but if both I am my late descendant
find out come search in this country remote
Nearby are the glorious ashes of my solitary footprint
shore oblivion leave cold shadow
to he fly my grateful shadow
and be nice I am his memory
may the cherished tradition be preserved
how do you feud submit fate
not glory fate I am equal to be you
here lyre northern desert proclaim
I wandered that day as if on the banks of the Danube
magnanimous greek freedom to call
and not a single friend of mine in the world will listen
but the alien hill field and sleepy grove
and the muse is peaceful I will be benevolent
try to observe various signs
shepherd and farmer in infancy
look at the sky to the west shadow
to be able to predict both wind and clear day
and the May rain is a joy to the young field
and frost early cold dangerous grapes
so if the swan on the bosom quiet water
splash evening call your arrival
or the bright sun goes into a sad cloud
know tomorrow sleepy maiden wake up roaring rain
or hail beats on the windows and early peasants
get ready to mow the tall grain valley
hear storm noise don't go to work
and plunge back into lazy slumber
and you can verify that I can
like a simpleton Agnès
what novel do you find yourself in
to die from love rake
listen you thirty years
yes thirty years a little more
I'm in my twenties and I've seen the light
spin for a long time in he is at liberty
already an oath a tear I'm funny
leprosy to tire to keep up
you too with your side
betrayal is true to be annoying
settle down we cool down
we don't have to learn again
we know eternal love
barely three weeks to live
we were friends to begin with
but boredom is the case of a jealous husband
I'm crazy to pretend
and pretend you are shy
we swear later alas
then forget our oath
Cleon love you
and I am Natasha's confidante
We'll leave before that time
all is well decent
If only we could live without distant quarrels
again, friendly and calm
but not this morning
you suddenly find yourself in a tragic heat
gray resurrect antiquity
you preach again
late knight love
polite heat and sadness and jealousy
pardon no right no
I am not a child, even though I am a poet
when we are going to sunset
leave youthful ardor passion
you are the eldest daughter of yours
I am my little brother
They can be naughty in life
and tear to prepare yourself for the future
They still love to pester
and it's time for us to gossip
leave honor to fate
davydov living victim fury
from a young age to love the opposite sex
and suddenly trouble executes her mercury
it's time for her to come and repent
she lies eyes swell little by little
what if it bursts, thank God, lady
everything is good here is a new hole
don't pretend my dear friend
my opponent is broad-shouldered
you are not scary lyre sound
not an elegiac speech
give hand i you are not jealous
I am too flighty and lazy
your beauty is not a fool
I see everything and don't get angry
she is lovely laura
Yes, I'm no good at Petrarch
my dear how unfair
your jealous dream
I forget love call
and the captivity is dangerous beauty
freedom is a peace-loving friend
in the crowd beauty young
I am indifferent and lazy
don't see your god in them
their languid gaze, welcoming babble
I am no longer powerful, I need to be
forget the heart's tender tremor
and the flame of youth is alive
Now it's hard for me to fall in love
sigh awkwardly and funny
hope believe recklessly
It is a sin to cheat on a husband
pass a cheerful life holiday
like my thoughtful prankster
as Baratynsky I repeat
can't you find a gentle friend
Is it possible to find reliable love?
and find nothing
leave happiness a false phantom
without intoxicating passion
I become a cautious confidant
my inexperienced friend
when the lover is frantic
yearn cry in front of me
and for the beauty arrogant
swear to sacrifice oneself
when in the heat your desire
he explains with delight
unclear dark expectation
deceptive but sweet dream
and firmly squeeze each other's hands
curse a jealous spouse
or a pestering mother
his crazy assurance
and minute-by-minute repetition
love with participation listen
I flatter the blind he hope
I am young, youth is alien
and say so be before
in time and with me
in your room my gentle friend
I'm coming for the last time
love happy serene
share the last hour with you
forward one in hope languid
I can't wait in the dark middle of the night
until the first morning ray
do not burn the candle
do not wish for someone else's good
you are my god I command
but the measure of my strength you know
Am I a gentle feeling to control
to offend a friend not to wish
and he doesn't want to village
I don't need it, I'm his lover
I look at everything calmly
he is neither a house nor cattle nor a slave
I'm not flattering, I'm all goodness
but if his slave
lovely lord i'm weak
and if his girlfriend
sweet as an angel in the flesh
oh righteous god forgive
I envy the bliss of a friend
who can command the heart
who is a slave, effort is useless
how can you not love the dear
how can you not wish for heavenly blessings
watch, languish and sigh
but it is a strict duty to be able to honor
fear desire heart flatter
to remain silent and suffer in secret

but my dear friend hug me
you are Ovid alive
another have my aglaya

another for money to understand
another for being French
Cleon's mind to frighten her
Damis for singing softly

why do you have your husband

you won't wait my friend lanov
slap from my hand
your solemn face
so similar to a woman's ass
why only ask for jelly
yesterday was a day of separation noisy
yesterday was a wild bacchus feast
at the click of youth crazy
with thunder the bowl with the sound of the lyre
so muse bless you

do not blind our eyes
She is not a vain job
we are not captivated by carving
but that's the only difference
that thirst Scythian to drink
bottle full pour in
in its wide edge
I drink and think heartily
fly in the past day
and grief is fleeting life
and remember the dream of love
I make them laugh, it's treason
and sorrow will disappear before me
how to disappear into a bowl of foam
under the hissing stream
how to get ready now prophetic oleg
take revenge on the foolish Khazar
they sat down and the field for a violent raid
he condemned the sword and fire
with his squad in Constantinople armor
the prince rides across the field on his faithful horse
from the dark forest to meet him
go inspired wizard
obedient perun old man alone

and to the wise old man Oleg approaches

and they don't need the prince's gift
their prophetic language is truthful and free
and with the will of heaven friendly

but to see your lot on the bright forehead
Now remember my word
warrior glory joy
victory to glorify your name
your shield on the gates of Constantinople
and the wave and dry you submissive
envy enemy so wonderful fate
and the blue sea is a deceptive wave
in the fatal hour of bad weather
and a sling and an arrow and a cunning dagger
spare the winner year
under the formidable armor you will not know the wounds
invisible guardian can give
your horse is not afraid of dangerous work
he senses the master's will
then stand meekly under the enemy's arrow
then rush across the battlefield
and the cold and the battle he is nothing
but you accept death from your horse
Oleg smiles but forehead
and the gaze was darkened by thoughts
in silence, the hand rests on the saddle
he got off his horse sullenly
and a faithful friend farewell hand
and stroke and pat on the neck steep
Farewell my comrade my faithful servant
to part, it's time for us to come
Now I can't even set foot on a rest
in your gilded stirrup
forgive, console and remember
you boy-friend take the horse
cover blanket shaggy carpet
to take to my meadow under the mouth
bathe feed select grain
spring water to drink
and the boy immediately departed with his horse
and the prince brought another horse
feast with the squad of the prophetic Oleg
when ringing a cheerful glass
and the curls are white as morning snow
above the glorious head of the mound
they remember the past day
and the battle where they fight together
and where is my friend, Oleg?
tell me where my spirited horse is
is he still healthy and running so easily
is he still the same wild and playful one?
and listen to the answer on the steep hill
he has long since fallen asleep
mighty oleg head droop
and think what is fortune telling
you are a magician, a lying, crazy old man
I would despise your prediction
I would still carry my horse
and he wants to see the horse bone
here comes the mighty Oleg from the yard
with he igor and old guest
and see the hill at the banks of the Dnieper
lie noble bone
they wash rain fill them with dust
and the wind stirs above them feather grass
the prince quietly stepped on the skull of the horse
and say sleep friend lonely
your old master you worry
I'm not far off for the funeral feast
it's not you who will stain the feather grass with an axe
and give my hot blood to my ashes to drink
so this is where my doom is hidden
I threaten death with a bone
from dead head grave serpent
hiss between then crawl out
like a black ribbon wrapped around a leg
and scream suddenly sting prince
ladle circular foam hiss
at the funeral feast, deplorable Oleg
Prince Igor and Olga are sitting on the hill
the squad feasts at the shore
fighter remembers the day gone by
and the battle where they fight together
My friend has been here for three days now
I'm sitting under arrest

so as not to make you angry at all
pious important fool
too prim censorship

nothing or very little
and that one will not happen
the princess is young

and for the mother sad
and from the midwife
how to find out about that people
everyone is opening their mouths here
gasp, groan, marvel
and another one even laughs
yes, quietly, so that we can get on our way
You can't get to Nerchinsk
the king summoned his court
nanny mommy submissive
they hold such an order
if any of you
It's a sin to teach a daughter
or they teach to think
or just hint
what do they lack
or ambiguous to say
or they show a fig
I'm no stranger to joking
woman cut out tongue
and the man is something bad
that it's time to be tough
the king must be strict but fair
and the order is eloquent
everyone bows down with fear
beware of every decision
everyone should keep their ears open
and keep your property
poor wife afraid
so that the husband doesn't blab
secretly think husband
My wife is guilty
you can see the heart is angry
grow up my princess
It's a pity they become the king in the council
to present your subject there
so and so it's pretty clear
quietly whisper behind the scenes
be careful of the servant
boyars to ponder
how to treat such an ailment
here is one old adviser
bow down all and suddenly
to slam a hand into a bald forehead
and the king he is so blabbering
O wise sovereign
do not exact my you insolence
if about carnal abomination
tell what to be in the old days
I am a familiar matchmaker
where is she and what is she doing today
true the same than to be

weakness member heal
she would be the one to look for
witch fixes everything
and what needs to be inserted
so she's sending now
exclaim Tsar Nikita
to frown angrily
immediately the witch will find
if we she deceive
what should not be taken out
we'll spend it on the bob
or with intent to lie
I'm not a king but a slacker
if on Clean Monday
the witch said not to burn
and then beg the sky
here's a secret, careful
by courier postal
and the whole earth is at an end
be send a messenger
they jump and prowl everywhere
and the king of the witches to look for
a year passes and another
there is no news
finally one zealous one
suddenly attack a lucky trail
he drives into a dark forest
It is clear that he himself is a demon
he sees a hut in the forest
witch in she live old woman
how can he be the tsar's ambassador
then she goes straight to it and enters
bow down witch boldly
to state the Tsar's case
how a princess gives birth
and what to deprive of everything
witch moment to figure everything out
she pushed the messenger into the door
so say to leave
soon and without looking back
not to be afraid of fever
come in three days
for the package and the answer
just remember a little bit with the dawn
after the witch locks herself
stock up on coal
three days of fortune telling
so what the hell is the devil to lure
to send to the palace
he himself brings the chest
complete sinful thing
we adore
there they will be all sorts
all size all color
all selected with curls
witch sorting through everything
forty good report
they wrap them in a napkin
and lock it in the chest with a key
with he send a messenger
give a silver piece for the journey
he goes to dawn to blush
make a rest want to
I'll want to have a snack
thirst quench vodka
he must be a neat little fellow
stock up on everything for the return journey
here is a horse he unbridles
and it becomes easier to eat
the horse is grazing, he is dreaming
how he the king exalts
count prince call
what is the point of closing the box?
that the king in the mute witch send
look in the crack no can't see
lock tightly how offensive
curiosity fear to take
and all of it is disturbing
he put his ear to the lock
nothing to hear hearing
smell a familiar scent
ugh, what a miracle!
it's not a bad thing to look at
and the messenger cannot stand it
but he only unlocks the chest
the bird flutters and flies away
and sit on the branch all around
and twirl your tail
our messenger give they call
they are tempting the cracker
crumbs, it's all in vain
apparently feeding is not right
they sing beautifully on the bitch
why sit in the chest
here we are dragging ourselves along the road
all bent over in an arc
old woman with a crutch
our messenger she will thump in the leg
I'm going to disappear from my head
help to be a mother
look what a disaster
they can't catch
how to help grief
look up old woman
spit and hiss
you act even though it is bad
but don't cry, don't grieve
you they only show
I'll probably fly away myself
Well, he said thank you
and just to show
the bird instantly flew to him
and take possession of the apartment
so that trouble does not know another
he is a long-winded excuse
they immediately turn the whole forty on key
and go home
how do they receive the princess
put it straight into the cage
the king is such a joy
set a feast immediately
feast for seven days in a row
a whole month off
the king will reward the entire council
and don't forget the witch
from the Kunstkamera as a gift
she sends the candle stub into the alcohol
the one who amazes everyone
two echidna two skeleton
from the same office
to reward be and messenger
here is the end of the story
love your unknown twilight
and your secret flower
oh you poetry lovely
blessed dream
you we assure poet
that shadow light crowd
from the shore cold summer
flock to the shore of the earth
and invisible to visit
the place to be is all mile
and in a dream to console
heart to leave friend
they taste immortality
they are waiting in elysium
how to wait for a family feast
your slow down guest
but it could be an empty dream
be able to with a coffin robe
I throw all my earthly feelings
and I am alien to the earthly world
be able to be where everyone else shines
imperishable glory and beauty
where pure flame devours
imperfection of being
minute life impression
my soul does not save
not to know regret
longing love forget i
you are with me again, pleasure
in the soul the gloomy thought subsides
monotonous excitement
resurrect feeling clear mind
some unknown nega
I am so sad
animated field
Taurida hill is a lovely region
I'm visiting you again
drink languidly air voluptuousness
as if hearing a close voice
long lost happiness
happy land where water sparkles
caress the lush shore
and light luxury nature
illuminate the hill meadow
where the rock is a frowning vault
behind it is the slope of the mountain
I go along an unknown road
and notice my timid gaze
the trace of her foot is lovely
why not dare to leave her trace
touch hot lips
they sprinkle burning tears
no never in the middle of a stormy day
my rebellious youth
I don't want to be so excited
kiss the lips of young Circe
and Percy is full of languor
alone alone stay me
feast mistress friend
disappear with a light dream
my youth will fade
with her unfaithful gift
so the candle burns in debt all night
for the frisky young man and maiden
at the end of a mad feast
turn pale before the light of day
otherwise I'm proud of my singer
what to attract to be able to verse
attention fiery heart
play laughter and tears
It's not that I'm proud of it sometimes
my insidious chant
to humble the young maiden in thought
excitement fear and shame
not like the satyr's pillar
debauchery and malice I will execute
and what threatens the voice of the lyre
it's not true to horrify
that unyielding inspiration
and my stormy youth
and passion will and persecution
I become famous among people
another high reward
I am destined to be
selfish thought joy
daydreaming vain dream

Isn't it you who is portraying

to recognize or see as in a dream
and the unforgettable image hides

you are a wizard to tempt
an involuntary trepidation arises
in your chest selfish
and you lean towards his shoulder

I'm new enjoy them

and the clique is joy crazy
and the peaceful muse is a momentary gift
and babble glory noisy
I know friendship and life young
she gives away a windy year
and believe she is for the circular cup
at an hour of fun and freedom
I know love is not gloomy melancholy
not a hopeless delusion
I know love lovely dream
charm rapture
young conversation leave the glitter and noise
I know both work and inspiration
and it's sweet to be a hot thought
solitary excitement
but everything goes on and the blood in the heart gets cold
I can now see in their nakedness
and light and life and friendship and love
and the dark experience of hating
your seal to lose your playful disposition
the soul grows numb from hour to hour
in she feeling no longer so light leaf oak grove
in the Caucasian key to stone
expose the captivating idol
I see an ugly ghost
but why disturb the cold world now?

Is it really in this shameful depth
I enjoy the clear heart
what can I see in he is a young madman
what to look for what to strive for
who is who is the sublime soul
to idolize without being ashamed
I speak in front of the cold crowd
language is truly free
but for the crowd he is insignificant and deaf
funny voice noble heart
everywhere the yoke of an ax or a crown
there is a villain or a coward everywhere
tyrant flatterer
or prejudice is an obedient slave
gloomy guard muse my old persecutor
Today I'm thinking about thinking about you and me
not to be afraid not to want to seduce the thought false

or erase from a skinny magazine
mockery rude and vulgar abuse
polite witty witty tribute
but the censor is a citizen and his rank is sacred
he must have a direct and enlightened mind
he heart to honor to get used to the altar and throne
but he does not oppress opinion and tolerate reason

suspect everything in everything you see poison
leaving is perhaps not a commendable task
Parnassus is not a monastery and not a sad harem
and the right is never a skilled farrier
Pegasus should not be deprived of excessive ardor

when no one dares to call the fatherland
and both man and seal will crawl into slavery
no no it will pass destructive time
when ignorance bears russia's burden
where the glorious Karamzin will earn his crown
there the censor can no longer be a fool
correct yourself, be smart and make peace with us
it's all true to say you don't start arguing with you
but can the censor judge fairly?
I must spare this and that
Of course you are funny and I often cry
read and cross yourself, slander for luck
there is a fashion for everything, taste, for example

My young ear is captivated by the melody
and leave a flute between the veils

infancy passes like a light sleep
you are a carefree child to love
among the important muse you only remember him
and you he quietly visit
but will your image be the same as your attire?

where are you thunderstorm symbol freedom
rush over the involuntary water
my voice for you is both gentle and languid
disturb late silence night dark
Near my bed there is a sad candle
burn my verse merge and murmur
flow stream love flow full you
in the darkness your eyes shine before me
I smile and hear the sound
my friend my gentle friend love your your
envy you pet sea brave
under the canopy of the sail and in the storm gray-haired
calm harbor how long have you reached
how long has it been since the silence tasted a joyful moment
and again you call the tempting wave
give hand in we heart united passion full
for sky far for distant country
leave the shore of Europe dilapidated
search element other land tenant tired
greet you free ocean
the damned city of chisinau
you scold the language get tired
someday on the sinful roof
your dirty house
the thunder from heaven will certainly strike
and not find your trace
mouth perish flame
and the colorful house of Bartholomew
and the shop is a dirty Jew
so if you believe moses
perish unfortunate sodom
but with this cute town
I dare not compare with Kishinev
I am too familiar with the Bible
and not at all accustomed to flattery
sodom you know be distinguish
not just a polite sin
but enlightenment is a feast
hospitable house
and beauty is not a strict virgin
what a pity that there is early thunder
he will strike him down in anger
into the brilliant world of debauchery
God save man
and member of the Supreme Council
I would spend my life humbly
to paris old testament
but in Chisinau you know yourself
can't find neither dear lady
neither a pimp nor a bookseller
regret your fate
I don't know whether to come to you
in the evening, my dear, three handsome men
but somehow my friend
I just have leisure time
I will appear before you
you serve i will be glad
verse prose all soul
but Vigel spare my ass
my careless ignorance
slylycomemon outrage
and he is my existence
to unite with one's own forever
I become to look at his eyes
I am a poor treasure given life
with his unclear word
my soul sounds in tune
I look at the world with a clear gaze
and marvel in silence
does he really seem like me
so majestic and beautiful
that the dreamer is young
you in he to seek what to strive for
who is an enthusiastic soul
idolize not be ashamed
and I cast my gaze on the people
see their arrogant low
cruel windy judge
a fool always commits villainy close
before the fearful they crowd
cruel, vain, cold
funny voice really noble
futile experience of centuries
you are a right wise people
what is freedom a free cry
the herd is not a needed gift freedom
they should cut or trim
they inherit from generation to generation
yoke with rattle and whip
it happened in sweet blindness
I believe the chosen soul
I think they have a secret birth
please the powerful sky
they indicate an opinion
I barely get close to them
hope sweet baby breathe
when would I believe that there is no soul
from decay to run away to carry away the thought eternal
and memory and love in the abyss of the infinite
I would have swear long ago to leave this world
I would crush the life of an ugly idol
and fly away to the country of freedom and pleasure
in a country where there is no death where there is no prejudice
where the thought alone floats into heavenly purity
but it is vain to indulge in a deceptive dream
my mind persist hope despise
I'm a nonentity, I'm waiting for the grave
like nothing neither thought nor first love
I'm scared and sad to look at life again
and want to live long so that the image of my dear one will be long
hide and glow in my sad soul
your terrible hour will come, heavenly eye
cover my friend fog eternal night
eternal silence your lips close
you will go to that dark place forever
where does your great-grandfather rest in cold power
but I am still your joyless admirer
I will go to the sorrowful abode for you
and sit down nearby you sad and dumb
your cute feet are on your knees
to fold and be wait sadly but what
so that the power of my dream
Vespers is long gone
but the cell is quiet and dark
the abbot himself is already strict
stop your prayer
and bend the old bone
to cross oneself on the bed of the poor
there is sleep and silence all around
but the church door is open
tremble beam lamp
and it dimly illuminates
and dark painting icon
and gild the salary
and resound in the silence
now a heavy sigh, now an important whisper
and gloomily doze in the heights
the ancient vault is dull and damp
stand behind the choir monk
and the sinner is motionless both
and whispered like a voice from the grave
and the sinner is pale as a corpse
monk
unhappy stop completely
terrible confession villain
pay you tribute
then who will rage in revenge
slyly sinner observe
and lead to eternal destruction
to humble oneself to come to one's senses time time
cover
I will allow you to sin
lay down a painful burden
on the day when i was new
the whole impression of being
and the gaze of the maiden and the noise of the oak grove
and the night the nightingale sings
when the sublime feeling
freedom glory and love
and inspired art
to excite the blood so much
hours of hope and pleasure
melancholy sudden autumn
then some evil genius
I become secretly visiting
Our meeting will be sad
his smile wonderful look
his sarcastic speech
pour cold poison into the soul
inexhaustible slander
he tempts providence
he is called a beautiful dream
he despises inspiration
don't believe he love freedom
look at life with a mocking eye
and nothing in all nature
he doesn't want to bless
should i forgive a jealous dream
my love crazy excitement
you i am faithful why do i love you
always scare my imagination
surround the fan crowd
why do you want to seem cute for everyone
and all that gives is empty hope
your wonderful gaze is sometimes tender and sometimes sad
I take possession I cloud the mind
confident in love my unhappy
you don't see when in a crowd of their passionate
conversation stranger alone and silent
I am tormented by annoyance and loneliness
neither a word nor a look my cruel friend
Do you want to run away with fear and prayer?
your eye does not follow me
should the beauty have another one
ambiguous conversation with me
you are calm, your reproach is cheerful
I am killing love by not expressing it
I would also like to say that my eternal rival
I am alone with you at the outpost
why do you greet slyly
what did he say, what right did he have?
to have him turn pale and be jealous
at the immodest hour between evening and daylight
without mother one half-dress
why should you accept it
but I love alone with myself
you are so gentle your kiss
so fiery word your love
so sincerely full of your soul
you are funny my torment
but I love you I understand
my dear friend do not torment I beg
you don't know how much I love you
You don't know how hard I suffer
freedom sower of the desert
I leave early before the stars
hand pure and innocent
to enslave the reins
throw the life-giving seed
but I only lose time
good thought and work
peaceful people graze
you will not wake up the honor cry
to what herd gift freedom
they should cut or trim
they inherit from generation to generation
yoke with rattle and whip
I have had a memory of her for a long time
carry in the heart depth
she minute attention
I am happy to be here for a long time
repeat I subside enchant
my poem despondency sound alive
it's so cute how she repeats
noticed her soul
again the lyre to get off and secret flour
she listens with participation
and now she transmits
its captivating sound
quite my pride
I think to be with affection
I am grateful to be obliged to her
and maybe there will be inspiration
how wayward our heart is
to languish again
I beg you recently
cheat my love
participation tenderness feigned
to animate your wonderful gaze
play my soul humble
she pours fire and poison into it
you agree nega wet
fill your languid gaze
you look thoughtful and important
your lustful talk
and that which is allowed tenderly
and what I forbid
It's inevitable to be impressed
into the depths of my heart
although it is hard at times, she is a burden
cart for easy running
coachman dashing gray time
carry not to get off the box
In the morning we get into the cart
we are glad to break our heads
and despise laziness and negligence
shout go
but at noon there is no longer that courage
shake we we are scared
and the slope and the ravine
shout easy fool
roll on the old cart
By evening we get used to it
and doze off to go to the overnight stop
and it's time to drive the horse
motionless guard doze on the royal threshold
the lord of the north alone in his palace
silently watch and lot earth
in crown head cramped lie
it's time to fall out
and the quiet world is a gift of captivity to bear
and the master himself marvels at his work
it is good for him to think and for his gaze to wander
from the Tiber shaft to the Vistula and Neva
from Sarsky-Selsky Linden to Gibraltar Tower
everyone silently waits for the blow
all mouth under the yoke bow down the whole chapter
to happen to say he long ago whether people world
fall to praise the great idol
how long has old Europe been raging
hope new germany boil
stagger austria naples rebel
beyond the Pyrenees long ago fate people
freedom is the rule
and autocracy only covers the north
how long ago and where are you creator freedom
Well, why should I rhetoric about looking for the right nature
worry sage mad crowd
here is Caesar, where is Brutus, the formidable orator
kiss the rod russia
and you trample the iron foot
he is a river and some invisible spirit to blow
to blow and die down and blow past again
Lord of the North Instant Cold Embrace
he looked at the royal threshold with confusion in his eyes
the sound of midnight is heard
and behold, a sudden guest appeared in the king's palace
then this wonderful man is a messenger of providence
the executor of the fatal unknown command
this rider before whom bowed the king
rebellious liberty heir and murderer
this cold bloodsucker
this king disappears like a dream like a shadow dawn
neither fat idleness lazy wrinkle
neither the heavy gait nor the early gray hair
nor the pale flame frown
do not expose in mute expel hero
torment peace
at sea to execute by mania king
no, his wonderful gaze is alive, elusive
then lost in the distance, then suddenly irresistible
like a battle thunderbolt like lightning to sparkle
in bloom health and courage and power
Lord of Midnight
lord west threaten to come
such is he when in the plain of Austerlitz
squad north drive him right hand
and the Russian for the first time before death to run away
such is it when with a victorious agreement
and with peace and with shame
before the young king he stands in Tilsit
no my fat aristop
although I love your conversation
your sweet disposition your sweet wheeze
your taste and fatty lunch
but I can't swim with you
to the shore of midday Taurida
I ask you not to forget
Favorite Bacchus and Cypris
when the consumptive father
a bit skinny aeneid
to finally set sail
he is Horace, a clever flatterer
send a solemn ode
where is friend august singer
promise good weather
but I do not write a flattering ode
you are not consumptive, thank God
I ask you from heaven
just an appetite for the road
why do you send to be and who do you send
what good or evil you are faithful to be the doer
why fade away why shine
earth wonderful visitor
broadcast scribe worry king
the crowd in front of them are worried
expose empty altar
freedom storm rise
and suddenly come and fall into dust and blood
the old tablet breaks
appear husband fate slave calm down again
the sword and chain will sound
and proud and naked come debauchery
and the front heart freezes
forget about the fatherland for the sake of power
sell for gold brother brother
to say madman no freedom
and he will trust the people
and indifferently in their speech
good and evil all become shadow
everything is to be despised
like the wind betrayed the earthly dust
the sea is a handsome man with wings
you call to swim swim
and keep the priceless pledge
prayer hope and love
you are the morning wind breath
happy sail strain
you are a sway
She doesn't tire her chest
oh god peaceful field oak grove and mountain
my apollo your love conversation
between you I find and the young muse
girlfriend my innocent simple day
but isn't he a dear friend?
and my wayward sorceress
like a quiet breeze or a golden bee
or a fleeting kiss to fly back and forth
splash wave phlegethon
the vault of tartarus trembles
Pale Horse Pluto
quickly to the nymph of pelion
along the deserted bay
Proserpine followed him
indifferent and jealous
flow one way
pre goddess knee
the young man timidly bowed
and the goddess of flattery is treason
Proserpine the mortal dear
hell proud queen
look young man call
hug and chariot
I'll take them to hell
rush to dress the cloud
see the eternal meadow
Elysium and the languid summer
lull the shore
there is immortality, there is oblivion
there is no end to joy
Proserpine in rapture
without porphyry and crown
obey desire
to betray his kiss
secret beauty
to drown in voluptuous bliss
and be silent and moan languidly
but love runs away
splash wave phlegethon
the vault of tartarus trembles
Pale Horse Pluto
he quickly rushes back
and Kerer's daughter leaves
and happy for himself
to bring out of elision
hidden path
and the lucky one to unlock
careful hand
door to fly out from
dream false swarm
Hello Wolf my friend
come here winter
yes poet of languages

Lyon is my curly brother

that the bottle is a full box
to feast already keep quiet
miracle life anchorite
in Troegorsk until night
and in Mikhailovsky before light
day to dedicate to love
night reign glass
We are dead drunk
then dead in love
sweet union from ancient times
poet to connect among themselves
they are the priest of the one muse
they stir up a single flame
each other is alien by fate
They are related by inspiration
swear ovid shadow
language close me you
there should have been a road to Dorpat long ago
I have to go out in the morning
and to the favorable threshold
carry my heavy staff
and return b lively
picture carefree day
conversation free-inspired
and your sonorous lyre
but I play happiness with anger
I've been homeless for a long time
where to blow autocracy
fall asleep not knowing where to wake up
always drive into exile now
drag out the day
hear poet my calling
my hope is not to deceive
in the village where peter is pet
king queen beloved slave
and their single-householder forgets them
hide my great-grandfather arap
where to forget elizabeth
and the courtyard and the magnificent vow
under the shade of a linden alley
he thinks in a chilled summer
about distant africa its
I wait you you with me
hug in a rural hut
my brother by blood and soul
You're a naughty boy to notice
and the muse is an exalted prophet
our delvig all for we leave
and glorify our trinity
exile dark corner
supervision deceive guard
praise liberty gift
and our youth is wild
awaken a noisy feast
attention friendly bow
to the ringing of a glass and a poem
and the boredom of a winter evening
wine and song to drive away
bookseller
a poem for you alone fun
It's a little bit worth it to squat
already have time to spread the glory
good news everywhere
poem speak ready
fruit new mental undertaking
so decide to wait I have a word
set the price yourself
poem favorite muse and grace
we will replace the ruble in a moment
and in a bunch of cash banknotes
turn your leaflet
why sigh so deeply
Is it possible to find out?
poet
I'm far away
I have time to remember
when hope is rich
I am a carefree poet to write
from inspiration not from payment
I see the rock shelter again
and dark blood solitude
where am i at the feast of imagination
the muse used to call
my voice sounds sweet there
there is a share of bright vision
with inexplicable beauty
I need to fly and curl
inspiration at night
everything excites the tender mind
blooming meadow moon shine
in the chapel old storm noise
old lady wonderful legend
some demon to possess
my game leisure
for me everywhere he flies
I whisper a wonderful sound
and a grave fiery illness
be my full head
in she is a wonderful dream to be born
in size slim flock
my obedient word
and the ringing rhyme closes
in harmony my rival
be the noise of the forest or a violent whirlwind
or the oriole's living song
or night sea dull roar
or the whisper of a quiet river
then into silence labor
I'm ready to share, not to be
with the crowd fiery delight
and the muse is a sweet gift
do not humiliate shameful bargaining
I will be the keeper of their stingy
so exactly in mute pride
from the gaze of the hypocritical mob
gift mistress young
keep lover superstitious
bookseller
but glory to replace you
dream secret joy
you went hand in hand
meanwhile, like a dusty mass
stale prose and verse
wait in vain for yourself reader
and her windy reward
poet
Blessed is he who hides it to himself
soul high creation
and from a person as from a grave
don't expect retribution for feeling
Blessed is he who silently be a poet
and glory to the thorns not to twine
despicable blackness to forget
leave the world without a name
deceptive and a dream of hope
what is glory, whisper or reader
persecution or low ignoramus
or admiration fool
bookseller
Lord Byron may have the same opinion
Zhukovsky says the same thing
but to recognize the light and buy it
their sweet-sounding creation
and your lot is truly enviable
poet to execute poet to marry
villain thunder eternal arrow
to strike distant descendants
hero console him
from Corinne to the Cythera throne
to exalt your mistress
praise for you annoying ringing
but the heart of a woman is to ask for glory
for they write they ear
pleasant flattery anacreon
in the young summer we are a rose
Dear Lavrov Helikon
poet
conceited dream
joy youth crazy
and I am in the midst of a storm, a noisy life
seek attention beauty
lovely eye read
I am with a smile of love
lips whisper magic
I am my sweet sound
but he is a complete sacrifice of freedom
the dreamer will not bring
let their young man sing
darling darling nature
what am I to they are now in the wilderness
silently my life rushes
lyre moan faithful not to touch
their light windy soul
it's not pure imagination
we don't understand it
and the sign of god is inspiration
for them it is both alien and funny
when I involuntarily remember
come to inspire them with verse
My heart is so painfully ablaze
I am ashamed of my idol
what do I, the unfortunate one, strive for?
before whom to humiliate a proud mind
who is pure delight thought
idolize not be ashamed
bookseller
love your anger such is the poet
the reason for your disappointment
I don't know, but I'm an exception
for dear lady, really not
Isn't there really a single one worth it?
neither inspiration nor passion
and your song is not appropriated
almighty beauty of his
keep quiet you
poet
why a poet
disturb the heart with a heavy sleep
It is fruitless to torment his memory
and what's the matter light
I am still a stranger to my soul
should we keep the unforgettable image
love bliss do i know
longing or long exhausted
I hide my tears in silence
where is the one who is eye
I smile like the sky
all life one or two or night
and what about the annoying moan of love
the word show my
madman wild babble
there the heart they understand one
and then with a sad shudder
fate decides
ah thought about that soul withered
I wish I could revive youth
and the dream is poetry
the crowd is outraged again
She alone would understand
my unclear verse
one would burn in the heart
lamp pure love
alas, a vain wish
she rejects the spell
prayer longing my soul
earthly delight outpouring
She is not needed as a deity
bookseller
so love is tired
boring babble rumor
you refuse in advance
from your lira inspired
now leave the noisy light
and muse and fickle fashion
what should you choose?
poet
freedom
bookseller
great, what a piece of advice
listen to the truly useful
our age is a trader, this age is iron
without money there is no freedom
that glory is a bright patch
singer on shabby rags
we need zlata zlata zlata
save gold until the end
anticipate your objection
but you i know sir
you are your dear creation
while on the flame labor
boil, seethe, seethe imagination
it will freeze and then
you and the essay will be ashamed
let me just say you
don't sell inspiration
but you can sell the manuscript
why delay, I'm already coming in
impatient reader
around the bench journalist wander
for they are a skinny singer
who ask for food for the satyr
some for the shower some for the pen
and confess from your lira
to foresee much I am good
poet
you are absolutely right here is my manuscript
agree upon
Goodbye free element
the last time before i
you roll the blue wave
and shine proud beauty
like a friend's mournful murmur
as his call at the farewell hour
your sad noise your inviting noise
I hear for the last time
my soul is the desired limit
how often on your shore
I wander quiet and foggy
cherished intention to languish
how i love your review
dull sound abyss voice
and silence in the evening
and wayward impulse
humble sail fisherman
your whim to keep
glide bravely through the swell
but you will rise up irresistibly
and the flock will sink the ship
can't leave forever
I am a boring motionless shore
you are delighted to congratulate
and guide along your spine
my poetic escape
you wait you call me to be fetter
my soul is torn in vain
mighty passion to enchant
I will stay by the shore
what to regret where would be now
I set out on a carefree path
one item in your desert
my soul would amaze
one rock tomb glory
there to plunge into a cold sleep
memory majestic
Napoleon is fading away there
there he will rest amidst torment
and after him like a storm the noise
another from us rush away genius
another ruler of ours is the Duma
disappear mourn freedom
leave the world your crown
make noise get excited bad weather
he is about the sea your singer
your image to be on mute mean
he is the spirit to create be yours
how powerful you are, deep and dark
how are you nothing indomitable
the world will be empty now where will it go
I would take you out of the ocean
fate man is the same everywhere
where there is good there is already a guard
either enlightenment or tyrant
farewell sea don't forget
your solemn beauty
and for a long time to hear be
your hum in the evening hour
into the forest into the desert silent
you are full to transfer
your rock your bay
and shine and shadow and the talk of a wave
singer of old among himself
feud our tribe
then our moaning side
then yours will perish under a thunderstorm
and you used to feast
Kremlin shame and captivity
and we are about a fallen stone wall
baby prague beat
when to trample into bloody dust
beauty Kostyushkin banner
and he who is with your virgin is not ours
ring cherished conjugate
we will not drink the cherished cup
health your red wife
and our young maiden
to attract the heart of a Pole
reject pride burn
love is the people's enemy
but the voice of poetry is wonderful
heart hostile be friends
before the smile of heaven
earthly hatred to remain silent
at sweet sound inspiration
at the song lyre
and rise blessing
the world will not descend on the tribe
when your friend is at your voice speech
answer caustic silence
when he is yours from your hand
like pulling away from a snake with a shudder
as if a sharp nail were looking at you
he shakes his head with contempt
don't say he's sick he's a child
he suffers from mad melancholy
don't say he's ungrateful
he is weak and evil he is unworthy of friendship
his whole life is some kind of heavy dream
Are you really right? Are you really calm?
ah if so he is ready to fall into dust
to beg each other for reconciliation
but if you are a saint friendship power
to use for malicious persecution
but if you are inventive to be sarcastic
timid his imagination
and proud fun to find
in his melancholy sobbing humiliation
but if the despicable slander itself
you mean he is invisible to be echo
but if he throws a chain on you
and betray the sleepy enemy with laughter
and he reads in your silent soul
all secret sad gaze
then step don't waste empty speech
you condemn the last sentence
you publish my uncle
creator dangerous neighbor
very worthy to be that
although the deceased conversation
and he doesn't notice
Now I publish, my friend
the empty fruit of my labor
but for the sake of Phoebus my pletnev
when will you be your own publisher
how to marry conceive the royal arap
walking between the noblewoman and the blackamoor
to look at the hawthorn blackamoor
what to choose arap yourself sudarushka
black raven white swan
and how black-skinned he is
and she is a white soul
oh rose maiden I am in chains
but do not be ashamed of your shackles
so the nightingale into the laurel bush
feathered king of the forest singer
near the rose proud and beautiful
in captivity it is sweet to live
and she sings a tender song
into the darkness of the voluptuous night
you are right when you are so correct
compare it with a living rainbow
you are cute as she is to the eyes
and how fickle her soul is
and with a rose similar you will shine spring
you are just like her before us
bloom lush beauty
and also inject God with you
but more than anything else, the comparison is with the key
I like him, I'm glad he's sincere
Yes, you are pure like him, both heart and mind
and of course it's cold
comparison other not so good
the poet is not guilty, the comparison is not convenient
you have a lovely face and a lovely soul
unfortunately incomparable

shine run and disappear
so life is time to run away
I'm going to disappear into the harem
night marshmallow
to stream ether
make noise
run
Guadalquivir
behold the golden moon rises
quietly listen guitar ringing
here is a young Spanish woman
leaned on the balcony
night marshmallow
to stream ether
make noise
run
Guadalquivir
throw off mantilla angel cute
and appear like a bright day
through the cast iron railing
leg marvelous thread
night marshmallow
to stream ether
make noise
run
Guadalquivir
gloomy day fade gloomy night mist
leaden clothes spread across the sky
like a ghost behind a pine grove
moon foggy rise
all the gloomy melancholy on the soul I bring
far away there the moon rises in radiance
there the air is filled with evening warmth
there the sea move luxurious veil
under the blue sky
it's time to go up the mountain now
to the shore to sink to make noise wave
there under the treasured rock
now she sits sad and alone
one no one before she does not cry does not yearn
no one she knee into oblivion not to kiss
one no one's lips she will not betray
neither shoulder nor wet lips nor snow-white chest
no one is worthy of her heavenly love
Isn't it true that you are the only one crying I am calm
but if
despise and voice reproach
and the sweet call of hope
go to foreign lands dust fatherland
shake off clothes from the road
the heart falls silent, the sleepy whisper
habit long weak voice
forgive the unfavorable limit
where did I see the light for the first time
forgive the gloomy canopy
where my day flows into silence
to fulfill passion and laziness
and the soul's pensive sleep
my brother on a dangerous day separation
all my heart is thinking about you
for the last time squeeze the same hand
and we submit to fate
bless the escape poet
 
somewhere in the excitement of light
my voice to remember sometimes
he fell silent under the distant sky
dream
one sad
fade away into the alien side
the desired hour is coming
and benevolent Slav
to my grave nameless
you slander the Saburs
my hussar's idea
How do I go for a walk with Kaverin?
scold russia with molostvo
with my chedaev read

but I don't want to tempt the tooth
your ass is dark

pronounce a blessing
you are a peaceful look, soul
heavenly angel consolation
may your day be clear
how sweet your gaze is now clear
among the bestlot land
may your lot be wonderful
swear even and odd
swear sword and right battle
I swear by the morning star
swear evening prayer
no don't leave me you
who is in the shadow of peace
I enter the chapter he loves
and hide from the watchful persecution
am I not the one who thirsts for a drink every day
you are a desert water
Isn't it me who gives your tongue a gift?
mighty power over mind
to be brave and despise deception
the path is true to follow cheerfully

O wife pure prophet
from all you wife distinguish
a terrible vice for you and your shadow
under the sweet canopy of silence
live modestly you pester
celibate virgin veil
keep a true heart
for neg, legal and bashful
and a wicked, sly look
not to see your face
and you about guest mohammed
he flocked to the evening
vanity light
confuse my prophet
in the soaring thought of the pious
don't like him, he's verbose
and the word immodest and empty

calmly recite the Koran
do not compel the wicked
Why should a man boast?
for that reason to appear naked in the world
that he will not breathe for long
that the weak die as the weak are born
Is it for this that God kills?
and he resurrects at will
what with the sky day he keep
and in joy and in sorrow
for that he gives fruit
and bread and dates and olives
bless his work
and Vertograd and the hill and the cornfield
but the angel will sound his trumpet twice
thunder from heaven will strike the earth
and brother from brother run away
and the son to separate from his mother
and everyone will come before God
disfigure fear
and the wicked mouth
cover the flames and ashes
with you of old, O all-powerful one
mighty compete think
crazy pride abundant
but you are the Lord he humbles
you are a river, I give peace and life
I am death earth to punish
raise my hand to everything
I am also a river he gives life
and also death to punish
You, God, are my equal
but to keep silent is a vice of boasting
from the word your anger
I will raise the sun from the east
raise it at sunset

and we should not suppress ourselves

let the sky and the earth shine
how to water flax with oil

the creator pray he is mighty
he rules the wind on a hot day
send a cloud into the sky
give the earth tree canopy
he is merciful he is mohammed
open shine koran
let us also flow to the light
and yes, the mouth with the eye is foggy
It's not for nothing that I dream of you
into battle with shaving the head
with a bloody sword
in the moat on the tower on the wall
listen to the joyful cry
oh child fiery desert
lead a young slave into captivity
share the spoils of war
you win glory you
and the faint-hearted are a laughing stock
they are on a military calling
don't go don't believe wonderful dream
be tempted by the spoils of battle
now in his repentance
they will say we take it from ourselves
but you say not take
blessed fallen in battle
now they enter Eden
and stomp into pleasure
do not poison anything
rise up timid

Prayer before morning

trade conscience before pale poverty
do not scatter your gift calculating hand
generosity full pleasing sky
on the terrible day of judgment, like a rich field
O prosperous sower
She will repay your labor a hundredfold
but if you pity the labor of earthly acquisition
hand over a beggar a stingy handout
squeeze your envious hand
to know all your gift is like a handful of dust
what to wash with stone heavy rain
disappear lord rejected tribute
and the tired traveler grumbles at God
he is thirsty and thirsty for shadow
wander in the desert for three days and three nights
and the heat and dust weigh on the eye
with melancholy hopeless drive he around
and he suddenly saw a well under a palm tree
and he rushes towards the desert palm tree
and greedily the cold stream refreshes
the tongue and the pupil burn heavily
and he lies down and falls asleep near his faithful donkey
and for many years it will flow
by the will of the Lord heaven and earth
awakening comes for the traveler hour
he gets up and hears an unknown voice
how long have you been deep in the desert
and he answers that the sun is already high
to shine on the morning sky yesterday
in the morning I sleep deeply until the morning
but the voice of the traveler you sleep longer
look to go to bed you are young and old to rise
the palm tree is already decaying and the well is cold
dry up and dry up in the desert waterless
long ago the sand covered the steppe
and your donkey's bone will turn white
and grief to embrace the instant old man
cry tremble head droop
and then a miracle will happen in the desert
past into new beauty to revive
again sway palm shady head
the well is filled with coolness and darkness again
and the old bone of the donkey to rise
and the body gets dressed and makes a roar
and feel the traveler and strength and joy
to play in blood to resurrect youth
holy delight fills the chest
and with God's help he sets out on his journey

and inspired with emotion
on the stone friendship to sanctify
I write our name

coastal reeds bend down
why to the distant sky
you drive away the cloud so angrily
recently black cloud ridge
vault sky deafly clothe
recently oak over height
in beauty, to boast arrogantly
but you rise you leap
you will make noise, thunder and glory
and disperse the stormy cloud
and bring down the majestic oak
let the sun's clear face shine
from now on it's a joy to shine
and the cloud marshmallow play
and the reeds sway quietly
let love be crowned with beauty
in the treasured gold to keep her trait
and letter secret reward long torment
but in the quiet hour the agonizing separation
nothing nothing my not to please the eye
and not a single gift my beloved
holy pledge love consolation sadness tender
do not heal wounds love crazy hopeless

how a traveler perceives lightning in the desert
and everything before me was eclipsed and now
I am new to I desire to languish
I wish glory to my name
your hearing to be amazed all the time so that you I
to surround to be so that loud rumor
everything around you sounds like me
to listen to the faithful voice in silence
you remember my last prayer
into the garden into the darkness of the night into a moment of separation
Recently I started whistling somehow
and they issue it without my signature
magazine joke about they article print
without a signature let her in villain
but what am I, a street jester?
fail to cover up your leprosy
he recognizes me by his claw in a minute
I recognize him by his ear
I can't be able to for long
in exile peacefully remain
sigh for dear old man
and the rural muse in silence
the soul is carefree to indulge
but also to give to a foreign land
I am always thinking
wander around Trigorsk
in the meadow near the river above the hill
in the garden under the shade of the linden tree
when the clear day fades
one of the deepest graves
sometimes in the native canopy
fly yearn shadow
cast a sweet glance at someone dear
I keep my talisman
I keep in the day of persecution
repentance excitement on the day
you are sad in the day I give
when to raise the ocean
there is a roaring wave around me
when a thunderstorm breaks out a cloud
I keep my talisman
in solitude foreign country
on the bosom of boring peace
in alarm fiery battle
I keep my talisman
sacred sweet deception
soul magic light
it will hide change
I keep my talisman
Let the wound of the heart be in the century
don't spoil the memory
forgive hope sleep desire
I keep my talisman
meanwhile, the world was astonished
Byron look at the urn
and the European choir lyre
near dante shadow he listen
I call another shadow

with a bloody chopping block in the day of suffering
go to the graveyard

carry a grave flower
sound unknown lyre
I sing, he listens, and you
rise again tired axe
and the victim has a new name
singer ready thoughtful lyre
the last time he sings
tomorrow execution usual feast people
but Lyra is a young singer
what to sing about singing she is freedom
not change until the end
greet you my luminary
I praise your heavenly face
when it sparks arise
when you rise in a storm
I praise your sacred thunder
when he sweeps away the shameful stronghold
and the power of ancient pride
scatter ashes and shame
I see your son's civil courage
I hear a brotherly vow
magnanimous oath
and autocracy is a fearless answer
I see how they are a powerful wave
to overthrow everything to captivate
and the fiery tribune predicts complete delight
rebirth earth
your wise genius is already shining
already in the immortal pantheon
holy exile enter glorious shadow
from the veil of prejudice
unveil the old throne
shackles fall law
to rely on liberty to proclaim equality
and we exclaim bliss
oh grief oh crazy dream
where is freedom and law above us
one to rule the axe
we will overthrow the king, the murderer, the executioner
we elect a king o horror o shame
but you are sacred freedom
goddess pure no not guilty you
in a violent impulse blindness
into a despicable fury of the people
hide yourself from us, your healing vessel
hang a veil bloody
but you will come again with vengeance and glory
and again your enemy will fall
people taste once your nectar sanctify
they all look for again to get drunk
as if bacchus was enraging
he wander thirst torment
so he finds you under the canopy equality
in your embrace he sweetly rests
so the dark storm will pass
but I will not see you day glory day bliss
I am a doomed chopping block, the last hour
drag tomorrow execution solemn hand
executioner my head lift by hair
above the indifferent crowd
forgive, my friend, the homeless ashes
not to be rest in the garden where to see off
we are a carefree day in science and in a feast
and our urn's place should be designated in advance
but friend if about me
sacred are your memories
fulfill my last wish
mourn my dear lot in silence
fear arouse tear suspicion
in our age you know and tears are a crime
oh brother don't dare to regret now brother
one more prayer you listen a hundred times
verse flying thought careless creation
diverse cherished tradition
all my youth is my hope and dream
and tears and love friend this leaf
all my life I keep at Abel at Fanny
pray find they innocent muse tribute
gather strict light arrogant rumor
not to be aware they alas my head
untimely mouth my immature genius
for glory is not to accomplish a sublime creation
I will soon die but I love my shadow
keep the manuscript about a friend for yourself
when thunderstorm pass crowd superstitious
get ready to read my faithful scroll sometimes
and listen for a long time to say it is he
here is his speech and I forget the grave sleep
to rise invisible and sit among you
and listen to yourself and your tears
to be drunk and to be able to be comforted to be me
love can be and my prisoner
sad and pale verse love listen
but the song is gentle and instantly interrupted
young singer droop thoughtful head
it's time for spring with his love longing
rush before he beauty languid eye
and song and feast and fiery night
all together come to life and the heart rushes
far away and the murmur of the murmur ceases to pour out
where where to lure I am a hostile genius
give birth for love for peaceful temptation
why should i leave the unknown life shadow
freedom and friend and sweet laziness
fate to cherish my golden youth
carefree hand i crown joy
and the muse is pure to share my leisure
for a noisy evening a friend a beloved friend
I sweetly proclaim both laughter and verse
canopy guard home god
when will the bacchic anxiety get tired
and a new flame will suddenly flare up
I finally appear in the morning to my dear maiden
and she finds herself in confusion and anger
when with a threat and a tear in the eye
my curse century to lose in a feast
she I drive to scold and forgive
how sweetly my life flows and flows away
why is this life lazy and simple
I will rush to where the fatal horror is
where is the passion wild where is the violent ignoramus
and malice and self-interest where is my hope
you entice me what to do be me
I am faithful love verse and silence
to the low field with a despised fighter
Should I control a stubborn horse?
and it's cool to strain the powerless reins
and what should I leave behind, I will forget the trace
crazy jealousy and impudence insignificant
my voice and you, false phantom, perish
you are a word, an empty sound
Oh no
silence the faint-hearted murmur
the poet is proud and happy
you don't bow down, obedient head
before the shame of our year
you despise powerful villain
your torch will blaze menacingly
to illuminate the cruel shine
council ruler inglorious
your scourge will overtake them to execute
this executioner is autocratic
your verse whistle on their head
you call on they you praise nemesis
you sing marat priest
dagger and the virgin Eumenides
when the holy old man is torn from the chopping block
crown head hand numb
you boldly they both give hand
and before you tremble
Areopagus furious
proud proud singer and you are a fierce beast
my chapter play now
she's in your claw but listen to know godless
my cry my furious laughter haunt you
drink our blood live destroy
you are still a pygmy, a worthless pygmy
and the hour has come and it is already near
mouth tyrant indignation
finally rise up fatherland sobbing
awaken the weary rock
Now it's time to go but you step behind me
I'm waiting for you
so sings the rapturous poet
and all rests the lamp quiet light
turn pale before dawn
and the morning blows into the dungeon and the poet
raise an important gaze to the grating
suddenly noise come call they hope no
sound key lock bolt
call wait wait day only day one
and there is no execution and everything is freedom
and a living great citizen
among the great people
don't hear the procession wait silently executioner
but friendship is a mortal path poet to enchant
here is the chopping block he ascends he is glory to call
cry muse cry
you promise about romanticism
about this Parnassian atheism
talk to me some more
Poltava muse tells secret
and I write about her alone
no, this is clear my dear
no you are a Ukrainian lover
you are right that it can be important
a beautiful woman was born
smile gaze her eye
dear gold and honor
dear glory discordant
talk about her again
praise my friend her desire
have a rest give birth to a child
like his mother
and happy is he who shares with her
this pleasant care
she doesn't yawn
God grant that only hymen
meanwhile prolong your slumber
but I don't agree with you
I don't approve of divorce
first of all, faith is a holy duty
law and nature itself
and secondly, I notice
decent husband
for a smart wife necessary
when they are a home friend
either barely noticeable or invisible
trust my dear
one helping the other
and the sun will eclipse marriage
star shy love
I remember a wonderful moment
you appear before me
like a fleeting vision
like genius pure beauty
in languor sadness hopeless
in alarm noisy bustle
I will sound my gentle voice for a long time
and dream of a cute devil
go year storm gust rebellious
dispel the old dream
and I forget your gentle voice
your heavenly line
into the wilderness into the darkness imprisonment
My day drags on quietly
without deity without inspiration
without tears without life without love
soul to come awakening
and here you are again
like a fleeting vision
like genius pure beauty
and the heart beats in rapture
and for him to rise again
and deity and inspiration
and life and tears and love
shine moon motionless sea sleep
silent garden luxurious gassan
but who is there in the darkness sitting on a tree
on marble sad fountain
arap-eunuch harem guard gray
and with him his young comrade
mizrur illness mental anguish
I can't hide you from me
your gloomy gaze your angry murmur
your fierce dream
I have been saying everything for a long time now
I know life is hard
and what is your sorrow to blame

who could shake hands from the heart
and wish you a joyful year
I drink alone in vain imagination
around I call comrade
familiar inaudible approaching
and my dear soul do not wait
I drink alone and on the bank of the Neva
I call my friend today
but are there many of you to feast on?
who else is missing you
who change captivating habit
who from you to captivate the cold light
whose voice to fall silent at the fraternal roll call
who does not come who among you is not
he won't come our curly singer
with fire in the eye with guitar sweet voice
under myrtle italy beautiful
he sleeps quietly and is a friendly cutter
do not draw over the Russian grave
a word a few in the native language
so that there is no time to find a sad greeting
son of the north wandering in a foreign land
do you sit in a circle your friend
alien sky lover restless
or will you again pass through the sultry tropics
and the eternal ice of the midnight sea
happy journey from the lyceum threshold
you step onto the ship jokingly
and from that time on your road to the sea
oh wave and storm beloved child
you save in wandering fate
wonderful year original character
lyceum noise lyceum fun
amidst the stormy waves you dreamed of
you stretch out your hand from across the sea
you are the only one we carry in our young souls
and repeat for a long separation
we secret fate be able to condemn
my friend our wonderful union
he is like a soul, indivisible and eternal
unwavering free and carefree
he grows together under the friendly shadow of the muse
wherever we throw fate
and happiness wherever you go
all the same we are the whole world foreign land
fatherland we tsar's village
from edge to edge pursue the thunderstorm
entangle in a net fate harsh
I am in awe of the new friendship
tired of penetrating caressing head
with my sad and rebellious prayer
with trusting hope first year
friend other soul indulge tender
but bitter to be unbrotherly they hello
and now here in forget this wilderness
into the deserted monastery a blizzard and cold
I'm sweet get ready joy
three of you my friend soul
here I embrace the poet house of disgrace
oh my pushchin you are the first to visit
you delight the exile sad day
you turn his lyceum into a day
you gorchakov lucky from the first day
Praise be to you, fortune, cold shine
do not change your soul is free
you are still the same for honor and friend
we are on different paths fate appoints strict
step into life we quickly diverge
but by chance a country road
we meet and hug like brothers
when I comprehend fate anger
for everyone a stranger like an orphan homeless
under the storm head droop I am languid
and wait you prophet Permessian maiden
and you come son laziness inspired
oh my delvig your voice awaken
heart heat so long to put to sleep
and I cheerfully bless fate
from infancy spirit song in we burn
and we experience a wonderful excitement
from infancy two muses to we fly
and sweet to be their caress is our lot
but I already love applause
you are proud to sing for the muse and for the soul
I spend my gift as life without attention
you are a genius, you educate yourself in silence
service muse can't stand vanity
beautiful must be majestic
but we advise youth slyly
and noisy we delight dream
come to your senses but it's too late and sad
look back don't see a trace there
say wilhelm or else we will be with
my brother is my own by muse by fate

It is not worth leaving the world in error
hide life under the canopy of solitude
I'm waiting for you my belated friend
come fire magic story
heartfelt tradition come to life
talk about stormy day caucasus
about schiller about fame about love
It's time for me to feast on each other
to anticipate a pleasant meeting
remember the poet's prediction
a year flies by and I'm with you again
my covenant dream will come true
a year will fly by and I will appear to you
oh how much to get off and how much exclamation
and how much can the cup be raised to the sky
and the first full friend is full
and all to the bottom in honor of our union
bless rejoice muse
bless and long live the lyceum
mentor to preserve our youth
all honor, both dead and alive
raise the cup of gratitude to your lips
not remember evil, repay good
full full and the heart is on fire
drink it down to the last drop again
but for whom about each other guess
hurray our king so let's drink to the king
he is a man they rule moment
he is a slave to rumor, doubt and passion
forgive he is wrong persecution
he take paris he found a lyceum
let's feast while we're still here
Alas, our circle is thinning out hour by hour
some to sleep in the coffin, some to become orphans
fate look we wither day run
invisible to bow down and grow cold
we are approaching the beginning of our
who are we in old age day lyceum
one has to celebrate alone
Unhappy friend among new generation
a bothersome guest, an extra and a stranger
he remembers we and the day of the connection
close your eyes shake your hand
let him be with joy, even if sad
then this day is spent in the cup
how now I am your disgraced recluse
he spends without grief and worries
to the wilderness to be exhausted life Lenten
ache in the stomach
I don't care to sit like an eagle
and the sick idleness diarrhea
paper shore stock
strain inspiration alien
I rarely go to Parnassus
and only for great need
but your intricate manure
It's nice to tickle my nose
he resembles tails
father toothy pigeon
and my spirit calls again
ko defecation previous day
brow king frown
speak yesterday
blow down a storm
monument peter
that one will get scared
I don't know anymore
the king burst out laughing
first brother april
he speaks with grief
maid of honor palace
hang over the sea
for two -
then be aware
he suddenly said
hang by the neck
but a cruel law
into the forest into the darkness of the idle night
spring singer diverse
purr and whistle and rumble
but a stupid cuckoo
conceited chatterbox
one cook keeps repeating his own
and the echo after her is the same
we are bored to cuckoo
at least we run away to save God
from elegiac cook
movement no say sage bearded
another one to keep silent and stand in front of him to walk
I wish he could object strongly
praise everything the answer is intricate
but sir this is a funny incident
I will give another example from memory
because every day we walk before the sun
however, the stubborn Galileo is right
everything is a sacrifice in your memory
and the voice of the lyre is inspired
and the tear of the maiden is inflamed
and my jealousy trembles
and glory shine and darkness exile
and bright thought beauty
and revenge is a stormy dream
fierce suffering
what to do faust
such is the limit you suppose
No one can violate it
all rational creatures are bored
one from laziness, another from work
who believes who loses faith
he doesn't have time to enjoy it
he enjoys through measure
and everyone yawns and lives
and you all yawn and wait for the coffin
yawn and you too
rest shower
I am a psychologist, here is science
say when you don't miss
think about looking then
how to doze over virgil
and the rod will excite your mind
then how to crown like a rose
you are a benevolent maiden joy
and to initiate into the noisy riot
they are the evening's ardor hangover
then how do you dive?
in a magnanimous dream
into the abyss dark science
but then I remember it with boredom
like a harlequin made of fire
you finally call me
I'm a small demon wriggling
you try to cheer up
take both to the witch and to the spirit
and what is all this about nothing
wish you fame and achieve
want to fall in love and fall in love
you can take a toll on life
and to be happy
stop
I don't want to aggravate my secret ulcer
in deep knowledge life is not
I curse knowledge false light
and glory is a ray of happiness, it is accidental
elusive worldly honor
meaningless as a dream but to be
direct good combination
two souls
oh what a wonderful dream
oh flame pure love
there, where there is shadow, where there is woody noise
where the sweet-ringing stream
there on her chest is a lovely one
languid peace chapter
I am happy to be
heavenly creator
you are delirious faust in java
helpful recollection
you are deceiving yourself
Isn't it me who did your best?
deliver miracle beauty
and at the hour of deep midnight
she will then introduce you to her
the fruit of your labor
I'm having fun alone
how do you both remember everything?
when the beauty is yours
be in raptures and delight
you are a restless soul
already immersed in thought
and it's up to you and me to prove it
that thinking boredom seed
and does my philosopher know
what are you thinking at such a time
when no one thinks
should I say
you think my obedient lamb
how greedily I desire you
how cunningly in the virgin simple-minded
I dream of disturbing the heart
love involuntary selfless
she indulges innocently
Well, my chest is full now
melancholy and boredom hateful
my whim is a sacrifice
look revel in pleasure
with irresistible disgust
so reckless fool
to decide in vain to do an evil deed
slaughter a beggar in the forest
scold skin
so on the corrupt beauty
Having had her fill, she hurriedly
debauchery to look sideways fearfully
then from all this
You alone can draw a conclusion

recently you gave
storm haze sky cover
whirlwind of snow
then she howled like a beast
then cry like a child
then the roof is dilapidated
suddenly the straw rustled
like a belated traveler
to us to knock on the window
our dilapidated shack
and sad and dark

or doze off to the buzzing sound

live quietly across the sea
I sing a song like a girl

just blow some aquilon
and drip the aroma

soul you hurt
I kiss your kiss
I am sweet myrrh and wine
lean towards me head gentle
and may he rest in peace
while you die, have a fun day
and move the night shadow
you see the maiden on the rock
in clothes white over wave
when to rage in stormy haze
play sea and shore
when the lightning beam illuminates
she shines scarlet all the time
and the wind beats and flies
with her flying veil
beautiful sea in stormy haze
and the sky shines without azure
but believe me I am a maiden on a rock
beautiful wave sky and storm
what are you bothering about, prose writer?
give me the idea of what I want
she's the end of me sharpening
flying rhyme feather
put on a tight bowstring
obedient bow bend into an arc
and then send it at random
and woe to our enemy
in short day and night share
it's boring time
and the sun seems to be involuntarily
look at the field to clean up
what to do on a winter evening
don't serve yet we eat
Do you want to listen now?

I offer my love
neither our life nor our blood
she is a soul that cannot be touched hard
a tear just to be full
even though my heart is breaking with sadness
she's on a splinter -
but also - not to allow
I have to reckon with you again
singer love sometimes lively sometimes sad
you play the lira very nicely
You play Shtos pretty badly
five hundred rubles you lose

my fate is similar to your fate
now my friend see why
meadow scorch midday heat
poor shepherd sleeping with his flock
get tired under armor hero
it beckons the stream of coolness
here he finds peace to think
and here and here to find the unfortunate
the shelter is cruel and terrible
he's walking up a tree
everywhere the sign "meet"
he was amazed at this thing
notice familiar handwriting
involuntary fear of attracting him
he is a cute hand to recognize
and right in the heat of midday
Medora with Chinese princess
from the hut the shepherd here
the friend himself sometimes appears
Orland their name read
combined monogram
they are a letter every nail
hero heart pierce
try to lull the mind
he is being hypocritical with himself
not to believe he wants to at least believe
he tries to imagine
that the monogram in this wild grove
to draw all can be
another not this angelica
but soon the knight will say you
however, this is me, the devil
familiar very understand
Only she can invent this medoor
I am under this nickname
princess to be able to glorify
so the fable really replaces me
he thinks that fate is to help
but how can he be so cunning
to ease my torment
then the more evil suspicion
to burn again
so in the net bird friend freedom
the more you fight, the stronger
then get very entangled in it
orland go where the vault is
mountain bends to stream
crooked wander dodder
curtain be shady entrance
Medor with lovely angelica
love here at fresh water
on a hot day during quiet hours leisure
breathe into each other's arms
and here their name is all around
wood and stone to preserve
their chalk, coal or knife
everywhere lucky write
the sad count went there on foot
go and above the cave dark
see the inscription in praise fun
Medor her hand languid
write a poem that day
verse feeling tender inspiration
he writes in Arabic
and here they are, the exact meaning
flower meadow stream alive
happy grotto cool shadow
shelter love fun and laziness
where is young angelica
with lovely daughter galafron

so often you guard
one only to serve
praise and humble request
mister lover beg
give knight and all sorts
a stranger here or a traveler
which is on this side
fortune wind up by chance
on the water meadow on the shade and forest
call grace heaven
so that the nymphs love secretly
so that the shepherd never
don't drive the greedy herd
two three times and five and six
he wants to reread the inscription
the unfortunate man tries in vain
to say that there is no is to be
he really see see clearly
and unbearable melancholy
like a cold hand
squeeze the heart in silence terribly
and finally to his shame
he fixed his indifferent gaze
he is ready for grief, speechless
to lose the feeling to leave the light
ah I believe that there is no flour
such a torment this terrible
rest your beard on your chest
bow the brow kill pale
poor knight can't find
not a cry, not a tear
Crystal Poet Renew
decorate my peaceful corner
pledge poetry sacred
and friendship is a sweet pledge
there is a healing heat hidden in you
barely eloquent
you touched and in an instant
his mind is a playful fire
to penetrate into you mysteriously
under the blue sky my native country
she is languishing and fading
I finally need to fade away and that's right
the young shadow is already flying
but there is an inaccessible line between us
It is in vain that I arouse feelings
from indifferent lips I hear the news of death
and she listens to me indifferently
so this is who I love, my fiery soul
with such heavy tension
with such a tender, languid melancholy
with such madness and torment
where is the flour where is the love alas in my soul
for the poor gullible shadow
for sweet memory irrevocable day
find no way to get off no way to get off
so the sea is an ancient murderer
ignite your genius

kick out a hoof in front of you

but the intoxicating brew foams

fusion of rum and wine
water without impurities unfit for use
in trigorsk thirst free

young happy home
I don't understand your happiness
but keep quiet about everything
what a wonder what a mess
for my mind
the devil take it but it's your will
I can't say I'm nothing
what a holiday it is for me and Masha
friend my heart
never about our happiness
we have nothing to say
stand immediately guess
Woe to your heart
understand understand
there's no point in chatting
strict judgment and your word
value everything more than anything
Are you the only one who cares about our happiness?

he is my age, he is so cute
it's always clear that he is my brother
he is like a sister i love
tell me why I am guilty
No Masha, it's not your fault.
and this wedding will not happen
I love you even though I go crazy
even though this work and shame is in vain
and in this foolishness the unfortunate
I confess to your leg
I don't suit you and I'm not fit for the summer
It's time I was smart
but to recognize by all signs
illness love in my soul
without you i'm bored i yawn
I feel sad when you are with me I can't stand it
and can't say no want
my angel like me you love
when i hear from the living room
your light step or dress noise
or the voice of a virginal innocent
I suddenly lose all my mind
you smile, I am a joy
you turn away I'm sad
a day's torment is a reward
I am your pale hand
when diligently at the hoop
sit you leaning casually
eyes and curls drooping
I am silently tenderly moved
I admire you like a child
will you tell me my misfortune
my jealous sadness
when it's time to go for a walk in bad weather
you are going to travel far away
and your tear in solitude
and a speech in a corner together
and a trip to Opochka
and the piano in the evening
Alina, I need to have pity
don't dare demand love
be able for my sin
my angel i love is not worth it
but pretend this look
to be able to express everything so wonderfully
ah, it's not hard to deceive me
I am glad to deceive myself
spiritual thirst torment
I drag myself into the gloomy desert
and the six-winged seraph
I am at a crossroads
finger light as a dream
my pupil touch it
open the prophetic eye
how to scare an eagle
my ear touch it
and they fill with noise and ringing
and I listen to the trembling of the sky
and the flight of the mountain angel
and the bastard sea underwater move
and the vine's vegetation
and he presses his lips to my lips
and tear out my sinful tongue
and idle and deceitful
and the sting of the wise serpent
in the mouth to freeze my
put right hand bloody
and he and I cut the chest with a sword
and take out the trembling heart
and the coal will burn like fire
push the open one into the chest
I lie like a corpse in the desert
and God's voice is for me to cry out
rise up prophet and see and listen
my will be done
and go around the sea and the land
verb to burn the heart of a person
I see you I they read
this lovely creature
where is your languid dream
idolize your ideal
I drink poison in your gaze
in the soul to fulfill the devil
and into your sweet conversation
and into your fiery verse
rival forbidden rose
blessed immortal ideal
a hundred times blessed who are you to inspire
not much rhyme and a lot of prose
girlfriend my day is harsh
my decrepit dove
alone in the wilderness pine forest
long time ago you wait me
you are under your window, your little room
to grieve as if for hours
and hesitate every minute spoke
in your wrinkle hand
look into forget gate
to the black distant path
longing, foreboding, concern
to press your chest all the time
then you seem to be
at Galliani or Coloni
order yourself to Tver
with parmasan macaroni
let's cook some eggs
to have lunch at leisure
at Pozharsky's in Torzhok
fried cutlet taste exactly cutlet
and set off light

how to see turn blue
pour a glass of Chablis into the ear
so that the ear is like the heart
you can be in boiling water
put a little pepper
onion small piece
how happy i am when i can leave
annoying noise capital and yard
and run away into the deserted oak grove
on this silent shore the water
oh how soon will she sink to the bottom of the river
rise like a goldfish
how sweet is her appearance
from quiet wave at light night moon
entangle green hair
she sits on the steep bank
slender legs like foam white wave
caress, merge and murmur
her eyes sometimes dim, sometimes shine
like a star twinkling in the sky
there is no breath from her mouth but how much
piercingly this wet blue lips
cool kiss without breath
languidly and sweetly in the summer heat
cold honey is not so sweet thirst
when she playful finger
touch my curls then
instant chill like horror runs through
I have a head and my heart is beating loudly
languidly love fades away
and at this moment I am glad to leave life
want to moan and drink her kisses
and what sound can her speech make?
compare with she baby first babble
the murmur of water or the May noise of the sky
or the ringing boyana of the gusli
my first friend my priceless friend
and I am destined to bless

but it is true that he attracts the heart
but temperament is science
and be from a violent shooter
before he is an excellent long-armed
autocratic hand
he boldly sows enlightenment
do not despise your native country
he knows its purpose
sometimes an academic, sometimes a hero
sometimes a sailor, sometimes a carpenter
he is an all-encompassing soul
to be a worker on the throne forever
family resemblance be proud
to be like an ancestor in everything
how tireless and firm he is
and the memory of how kind he is
No, she is not a Circassian
but in Dol Georgia from centuries

on the road winter boring
troika greyhound running
monotonous bell
it's tiresome to rattle

so roll down from the top of the mountain into the foamy stream
the gray cliff stands in vain the shore trembles
thunder rumbles in vain and the waves rage around
and flutter and splash
one on the shoulders to raise powerful labor
you keep a watchful eye over the royal treasury
widow poor mite and tribute siberian ore
equally sacred before you
into the depths of Siberian ore

and the thought is a high aspiration

and brother, you give the sword
into silence garden spring into darkness night
sing over the rose oriental nightingale
but the rose dear does not feel does not listen
and to the accompaniment of a loving hymn to waver and doze
don't you sing for the cold beauty
to remember about the poet what are you striving for
she does not listen does not feel poet

God knows where they went
but you are my evil or good genius
when I see before me
your profile and eyes and golden curls
when I hear your voice
and the speech is lively and lively
I charm I grief
and shudder before you
and the heart is full of dreams

Goodbye my beautiful
away from you
with you to be inseparable
languid lips and languid eyes
to be tormenting memory
languish in silence
I don't want to be comforted
Are you both sighing?
if I were to hang
into the worldly steppe, sad and boundless
mysteriously break through three keys
key youth key fast and rebellious
boil run sparkle and gurgle
castalian key wave inspiration
to the steppe of the worldly exile to give water
the last key cold key oblivion

we are a lot on the boat
another sail to strain
the other one is pushing hard
into the depths powerful oars into silence
leaning on the steering wheel, our smart helmsman
in silence rule heavy cholna
and I am carefree, full of faith
swimmer I sing suddenly bosom wave
to crush with a raid whirlwind noisy
both the helmsman and the swimmer will perish
I'm the only mysterious singer
wash ashore thunderstorm
I will sing the old hymn
and my robe is wet
dry land in the sun under the rock
at the door of Eden a gentle angel
head droop shine
and the demon is dark and rebellious
fly over the hellish abyss
spirit denial spirit doubt
look upon the pure spirit
and an involuntary heat of tenderness
to dimly recognize for the first time
forgive he river you i see
and it's not for nothing that I shine
I don't hate everything in heaven
I do not despise everything in the world
what a night, the frost is bitter
not a single cloud in the sky
how to sew a canopy blue vault
variegated frequent star
it's all dark in the house at the gate
bolt with heavy lock
people are at rest everywhere
to calm down and the noise and shouting of trade
only the yard guard barks
and the chain rattles loudly
and all of Moscow sleep peacefully
forget the excitement fear
and the square in the twilight of the night
stand full yesterday execution
torment fresh trace all around
where to chop up a corpse with all your might
where is the pillar, where is the pitchfork, there is the cauldron
cool down full resin
here to overturn the chopping block
sticking out an iron tooth
with bone pile ash smolder
a dead man writhing on a stake
numb blackness
recently there was blood all over the place
stream skinny snow crimson
and a languid groan rises
but death touches them like a dream
to capture your prey
who's whose horse is at full gallop
to rush across the formidable square
whose whistle whose loud talk
resound into the darkness of the night
who is this brave pitch black man
he's in a hurry to fly on a date
desire boiled in his chest
he says my horse is dashing
my faithful horse fly arrow
soon soon but the horse is spirited
suddenly wave the braided mane
and become in the darkness between the pillars
on the crossbar oak
swing corpse rider harsh
under he rush to be ready
but a greyhound will fight under the whip
snore and snort and rush
back where my dashing horse
what to be afraid of what's wrong with you
Weren't we here jumping yesterday?
Are we not the ones who trample furiously?
zealous revenge of grief
the dashing traitor king
Aren't they the ones who wash away the blood?
your damask hoof
Now will they not recognize
my greyhound horse my dashing horse
rush fly and the horse is tired
jump into a pole
spring spring time love
how hard I am your appearance
what a languid excitement
in my soul in my blood
as a stranger's heart delights
all that rejoices and shines
to cause boredom and languor

and the long winter darkness night

to the sacred sacrifice of Apollo
in the care of the vain world

and between children the insignificant world
be able to all is insignificant he
but only the divine verb
to touch the sensitive ear
the poet's soul will stir
how to wake up eagle
he yearns for the world of fun
shun human rumor
to the foot of the people's idol
don't bow your proud head
he runs wild and harsh
and the sound and confusion are full
a wave on the deserted shore

and here the rusty lock squeals
squeal treacherous door
and go knight now
into the darkness of the majestic basement

protractedly repeat the sound of a step
In front of them there is a long row of coffins

At night he goes to the stables
clean groom boyar's horse
braid his mane into a pigtail
tie the tail tightly into a knot
how can he not fall in love with a crow
at dawn with a watering hole
I go around the boyar's stables
and go into the stall of the crow
the horse stands well and quietly
and in the morning unlock the stables
the horse is not quiet, all in soap, hot, puffing
Bloody foam dripping from the muzzle
the brownie rides on the mute all night
by the mountain by the forest by the swamp
from midnight till white light

where the sea splashes forever
on a deserted rock
where the moon shines warmly
in the sweet hour of evening mist
where to enjoy the harem

I will hand over the talisman

I drag out separation from my dear
but he is my royal hand
stretch out and with you again I
I honor him as an inspiration
he frees my thoughts
and I am in heartfelt emotion
he doesn't sing praise
I am a flatterer no brother flatterer sly
he brought grief upon the king
he is from his sovereign right
one only mercy to limit
he said to despise the people
wilderness nature gentle voice
he said enlightenment is a fruit
debauchery and a certain rebellious spirit
It's a misfortune in a country where there is a slave and a flatterer
one to approach the throne
and heaven is the chosen singer

in front of her she stands thoughtfully
take your eyes off she has no power

I am voluptuous to tire
and the whole secret is a kiss
and satisfy the wonderful bliss
but only morning purple
aurora eternal shine
swear under the death axe
head lucky man fall away
and now the day is already hidden
the golden-horned moon rises
Alexandrian palace
cover the sweet shadow
fountain beat burn lamp
light incense smoke
and voluptuous coolness
earthly god prepare
into luxurious gloomy peace
midst seductive miracle
under the canopy of purple curtain
shine golden bed
in the desert, stunted and stingy
on the soil heat to heat up
upas as a formidable sentry
cost one in the whole universe
nature thirst steppe
he gives birth to anger in a day
and the green dead branch
and give the root poison to drink
poison dripping through its bark
by midday melt from the heat
and freeze in the evening
thick transparent resin
he and the bird cannot fly
and the tiger can only go black whirlwind
Death is running up the tree
and rush away already pernicious
and if the cloud is watered
his dense leaf wanders
with its branches already poisonous
rain flowing into flammable sand
but man is man
send an imperious look to the upas tree
and he obediently set off on his way
and return in the morning with poison
he brings mortal resin
yes, a branch with a withered leaf
and sweat on his pale forehead
a cold stream flows
bring and weaken and lie down
under the arch of a hut on bast
and the poor slave dies at his feet
invincible ruler
and the prince feeds them poison
your obedient arrow
and with them to send death
to the neighbor in a foreign land
in vain the fiery poet
I bring my wonderful cup
and ask to drink to health
don't drink my dear neighbor
dear but cunning comrade
your cup is full of wine
but a delicious poison
he will lure me later
you're following again for glory
isn't he an experienced hussar
recruit recruit to bring
he is a merry bacchus gift
while the warlike frenzy
he won't mow it down in place
I am a soldier myself, I am going home
it's time to retire
stay you in line parnassus
before the event, pour the cup
and laurel cornelian or tass
one with a hangover to reap
and distrustfully and greedily
I look at your flower
who is a strict stoic to accept coldly
Hello Harit and beauty
I'm proud of him but also shy
your unspoken reproach
I don't dare to guess at all
Am I really going to incur your wrath?
oh how much flour would you need to cook yourself
beauty windy zoilus
when would treacherously slander
this floor which serve
love is madness and excitement
he would punish and you
be always b refutation
his sad slander
flower dry up become desiccated
forget in the book see i
and now the dream is strange
my soul is filled
where to bloom when what spring
and how long will it take to bloom and who will pick it?
is the hand a stranger or an acquaintance
and why should I think here?
in memory of a tender date
or a fatal separation
or a lonely walk
in the silence of the field in the shade of the forest
and is this one alive and that one alive
and now where is their corner
or will they already fade away?
like this unknown flower
bearded elder Avdey
With respect, my lady
instead of red egg
bring learned starling
I know you are such a bird
smart other sage
starling pouting majestically
sigh for the kingdom of heaven
and lisping
christ rises christ rises
heart i fly
to Tver to Moscow
how fast in the field around open
shoe my horse again run
how loudly under his hoof
earth frozen sound
useful russian health
our fortifying frost
lanita bright spring rose
play cold and blood
sad forest and withered valley
look through the day and it’s already dark
and like a belated traveler
the storm is knocking on our window
poet by lyre inspired
hand absentminded jingle
he sings but is cold and arrogant
there are uninitiated people all around
he is pointless to listen
and interpret the stupid mob
why does he sing so loudly
it's no use striking the ear
what is the goal we are leading to
what to jingle about what we learn
why worry and torment the heart
like a wayward sorcerer
like the wind his song is free
but like the wind and barren
what good do we do with it
keep silent senseless people
day laborer slave need care
I am unbearable, your insolent murmur
you are a worm of the earth not a son of heaven
you would benefit from everything by weight
idol you appreciate belvedere
you benefit benefit in he does not see
but this marble is a god, so what?
stove pot you are expensive
you are food in he cooks himself
no if you are heaven's chosen one
his gift divine messenger
we use it for good
heart brother fix
we are cowardly we are treacherous
shameless evil ungrateful
we are a cold eunuch heart
slanderer slave fool
nest club in we are vice
you can love your neighbor
we give a bold lesson
and we listen to you
go away what's the matter
poet peaceful to you
boldly turn to stone in debauchery
do not revive you lyre voice
soul disgusting you are like a coffin
for your stupidity and malice
have you up to now
scourge dungeon ax
Enough with you, crazy slave
into your city with noisy streets
sweeping away rubbish is useful work
but to forget your service
altar and sacrifice
priest, should you take the broom?
not for everyday worries
not for gain not for battle
we give birth for inspiration
for the sound of sweetness and prayer
What I was before, so am I now
carefree amorous you know friend
can one look at beauty without emotion
without timidity tenderness and secret excitement
I don't know how much love I can play in life
Is it not enough for me to fight like a young hawk?
to throw cypris into a deceptive net
and not to correct a hundredfold offense
I am the new idol to carry my prayer
you are spoiled by nature
she is addicted to you being
and our eternal praise
you seem like a nuisance ode
You yourself have known for a long time
it's no wonder you love
what a gentle look you are armida
what a light figure you are, sylph
what is your scarlet lips
like a harmonious rose
and our rhyme our prose
before you there is noise and vanity
but beauty is a memory
we touch the heart secretly
and the line is careless writing
to humbly contribute to your album
perhaps involuntarily as a memory
come you are who you are sing
that day as Presnensky field
the fence is not yet closed
drive up to Izhora
I look at the sky
and remember your gaze
your blue eye
although I am sad to charm
your virgin beauty
even if you call him a vampire
I am in Tver province
but my knee is before you
I dare not bow down
and a loving prayer
you don't want to disturb
getting drunk is unpleasant
hops secular vanity
probably forget
your dear trait
light frame movement slenderness
careful conversation
this modest calmness
a sly laugh and a sly look
if not, then still the trace
to your peaceful land
come back again in a year
and fall in love until November
I'm going to you, you're a living dream
behind me the crowd is curling playfully
and the moon on the right side
accompany my zealous run
I'm going away from another dream
soul to fall in love is sad to be
and the moon on the left side
I accompany sadly
dreaming eternal in silence
so we indulge ourselves poet
so superstitious omen

I am sad and light my sadness is bright
My sadness is complete you
you alone are my despondency
nothing to torment nothing to disturb
and the heart will burn and love again because of that
that it is impossible not to love
Farewell, dear Kalmyk
my idea is just a little bit out of spite
I have a commendable habit
do not get carried away among the steppe
following your kibitka
your eye is certainly narrow
and a flat nose and a wide forehead
you don't babble in french
you silk do not squeeze leg
in English before the samovar
pattern bread do not crumble
don't admire hay-mar
slightly not to appreciate shakespeare
don't get lost in daydreaming
when there is no thought in the head
don't sing
gallop not to jump into a meeting
that the need is exactly half an hour
while I'm harnessing the horse
I occupy my mind and heart
your gaze and wild beauty
each friend is not always the same
forget yourself idle soul
into the glittering hall into the fashionable box
or in a nomadic tent
blessed is your new feat
your path to the north is our harsh one
where spring reigns briefly
but where is hafiz and saadi

you visit our land midnight
leave a trace
flower fantasy oriental
scatter on the northern snow
live in the world a poor knight
silent and simple
with a gloomy and pale appearance
the spirit is bold and direct
he has one vision
incomprehensible mind
and deeply impressed
it will cut into the heart
travel to geneva
on the road at the cross
see he is Mary the Virgin
mother lord christ
from then on the soul will burn
he doesn't look at the woman
and to the grave not one
say the word not to want
since then steel grating
he can't lift his face
and a rosary on your neck
instead of a scarf tie
there is no prayer between father and son
nor the holy spirit ever
not happen paladin
He is a strange man
he spends the whole night
before the face of the Holy One
to direct a sorrowful eye towards her
quietly tears flow river
full of faith and love

meanwhile like a paladin

by plain palestine
rush to name lady

and drive him away with a threat

he lives strictly according to the rules
still in love still sad
he will die without communion
between how it ends
the evil spirit is coming
soul knight gather
the devil is already dragging himself to his limit
he is a god, you don't pray
he doesn't know about the post
there's no way to drag yourself around
he is for mother christ
but most pure heart
stand up for him
and let into the eternal kingdom

for a dashing rider

How long will I walk in the light?
sometimes in a carriage, sometimes on horseback
now in a kibitka, now in a carriage
sometimes in a cart, sometimes on foot
not in the hereditary den
not in the middle of the paternal grave
I know the big road
die lord judge
on the stones under the hoof
on the mountain under the wheel
or in the ditch the water is washed away
to dismantle the bridge
or will I catch the plague?
or frost will ossify
or should I slap a barrier on my forehead
clumsy invalid
or into the forest under the knife of the villain
I'll get caught on the side
or die of boredom
somewhere in quarantine
How long have I been in melancholy and hungry
to observe an involuntary fast
and cold veal
truffles bright remember
it's a different matter to be in place
to drive around Myasnitsky
about the village about the bride
to think at leisure
a glass of rum is a different matter
night sleep morning tea
it's a different story when my brother is at home
Well, let's go for a drive
fair wind blow ship
the flag is fully developed and swells
the sail is still going and in front of the stern
sea foam is heard many
the swimmer's chest filled up
now when to make a dangerous journey
they will see their native land again
standing alone, looking into the distance
and in the dark sketch he draws
a dream is a long-familiar object
the bay and the cape are still motionless
don't get sick comrade other
shake hands and welcome home
and thank the Lord and cry
another silent to create prayer
Saint and the Virgin
and alms and distant worship
ancient vow to renew
when he finds everything is fine
he is thoughtful and distant from everything
the honey itself is immersed in memories
oh glorious feat then in a dream hope
then into a sorrowful premonition and fear
beautiful evening and fair wind
sound between the rope and the ship reliable
run make noise between waves
the sun is setting
white-sided chatterbox
under my gate
jumping motley magpie
and I am a guest to prophesy
bell unheard of
I have a ringing in my ear
at dawn scarlet
the snow dust is silvering
winter what to do we are in the village i meet
servant carrying i morning cup tea
question is it warm or will the snowstorm subside
Will there be powder or not and can I go to bed?
leave for the saddle or well before lunch
messing around with an old magazine neighbor
when the snow falls we get up and immediately get on horseback
and a lynx across the field at first light of day
whip in hand dog after us
look at the pale snow with a diligent eye
spinning, prowling and it's late already time
two hares to poison to appear home
how fun it is, here in the evening the snowstorm is howling
candle dark burn shy heart ache
slowly swallow drop by drop boredom poison
read want eye over letter slide
and the thought is far away I close the book
take a pen sit forcefully pull out
the muse dozes incoherent words
to sound sound neit lose all right
above rhyme above my servant strange
the verse drags on languidly, cold and foggy
tired with lira i stop arguing
go to the living room and hear a conversation there
about close elections about sugar factory
the hostess frowns in the likeness of the weather
steel spoke nimbly move
or to guess about the king of hearts
it's so sad to go into solitude day after day
but if in the evening in a sad village
when I sit in the corner for checkers
to arrive from afar in a kibitka or a cart
unexpected family old woman two girls
two blond two slender sister
how to liven up the deaf side
how life oh my god becomes full
first indirectly-attentively looking
then a word a few then and conversation
and there is friendly laughter and song in the evening
and a brisk waltz and a whisper at the table
and a languid gaze and a windy speech
on a narrow staircase slow meeting
and the maiden goes out onto the porch at dusk
open neck chest and blizzard she in the face
but the storm north is not harmful russian rose
how hot kiss burn in the frost
like a virgin Russian fresh into dust snow
frost and sun, wonderful day
You are still dozing, my dear friend
It's time to wake up, beauty
open close nega gaze
towards the northern aurora
the north star appears
evening you remember blizzard get angry
the haze is rushing across the cloudy sky
the moon is like a pale spot
through the cloud gloomy yellow
and you sit sad
and now look out the window
under the blue sky
magnificent carpet
shine in the sun snow lie
transparent forest one blacken
and the spruce turns green through the frost
and the river will shine under the ice
the whole room is amber-colored
illuminate with a cheerful crackle
crackle stoke the stove
It's nice to think about the couch
but I don't know whether to order it into the sled
filly brown harness
slide on the morning snow
dear friend indulge run
impatient horse
and visit the empty field
the forest was recently so dense
and the shore is dear to me
gray whistle you reign with glory
it's time to lay down the crown
your pet is young, blooming and healthy
you will replace our great singer
I am a seasoned conversationalist
fate will happen arbitrariness
to be his young heir
whistle to ascend the throne
boy phoebus hymn to bring
I want to be but I have little brain
and how old is it, question
fifteen only hey rod
for this the seminarian brings
notebook lackey dissertation
and Phoebus read Horace out loud
bite lip first leaf
become heavy as if from dope
angrily phoebe he interrupt
and immediately a grown-up idiot
deliver to the stick order
I you love love still be able
my soul is not going to fade away completely
but let her not disturb you anymore
I don't want to make you sad you are nothing
I love you silently hopelessly
sometimes shyness, sometimes jealousy torments
I love you so sincerely so tenderly
how to give you god love to be another
memory confused
to fulfill sweet melancholy
the garden is beautiful under your sacred twilight
enter with droop head
so the boy bible is a crazy spendthrift
drain the remorse of the phial to the last drop
to finally see my native abode
head droop and sob
in the ardor of fleeting delight
into the barren whirlwind of vanity
oh how much I squander the treasure of my heart
for an inaccessible dream
and for a long time I wander and often tired
repentance grief foreboding trouble
I think about you, the blessed limit
imagine this garden
imagine a happy day
when among you arise lyceum
and hear our game I again playful noise
and see family and friend again
again a gentle youth, sometimes ardent, sometimes lazy
dream vague in my chest to hide
wander through the meadow through the grove silently
I am a poet, I forget myself
and in reality I see before me
the day before is a proud trace
still perform great wife
She is a favorite garden
stand inhabit the palace gate
pillar tower idol god
and glory to marble and copper praise
Ekaterininsky Orlov
sit down ghost hero
they dedicate a pillar
look here is the hero, the oppressor of military formations
perun kagul coast
here is the mighty leader midnight flag
before who the sea fire and swim and fly
here is his faithful brother, the hero of the archipelago
here is the Navarino Hannibal
among the holy remembrance
I've been growing up here since childhood
and in the middle of nowhere the stream of popular abuse
to rage and grumble
illegible hug bloody care
Russia move and we are past illegible
and a cloud of horse bearded infantry
and the gun is a bright row
to look enviously at the young warrior
catch with greed we abuse distant sound
and childhood is indignant and cursed
and the bonds of strict science
and many do not come when the sound of the song is new
glorious rest in the field of Borodin
on Kulmsky height in the forest illegible harsh
near Montmartre illegible
I'm ready to go wherever you are, friend
I am ready for you wherever you want to go
follow everywhere arrogant run away
to the foot of the wall is distant China
in Paris to boil or finally there
where tass no longer sings night rower
where the ancient city sleeps under the ashes of power
where the cypress grove is fragrant
I'm ready to go everywhere but friend
to say in the journey whether to die my passion
Should the proud, tormented maiden forget?
or to her leg her young anger
as a tribute to the usual love I bring
another high important song
listen to phoebus and fall silent lyre
to destroy your sanctuary
I hang and she publish
when the pole he shakes the storm
sad sound still one hymn
I listen to you, penates, you sing
votive hymn advisor zeus
Will you live in the heavenly depths?
or the supreme deity is all
the reason you are in my opinion a sage
and follow you solemnly
Great Zeus with his white-headed spouse
and the wise goddess maiden power
Athenian Pallas you praise
accept the hymn mysterious power
at least for a long time to be exile remove
from your sacrifice and quiet libation
but you love God did not cool down
and in the long deserted hour sadness
it's agonizing to ask to rest
your holy ashes
my soul is at peace there
so i love you for a long time you call
as a witness with what holy excitement
I leave the human race
to guard your secluded fire
talk to yourself yes
hours of indescribable pleasure
they give me to know heartily depth
in power and in weakness he
they i love cherish teach
not mortal mysterious feeling
and we they science first teach
honor yourself oh no forever
do not cease to pray reverently
you are a home deity
Should I wander along the noisy street?
should one enter a crowded temple?
sit between the crazy youth
I indulge in my dream
I say rush through the year
and no matter how much we can see here
we all go under the eternal vault
and someone's hour is already close
should I look at the lonely oak tree?
I think patriarch forest
to relive my forgotten age
how to experience he is a father
baby is it sweet to caress
I'm already thinking about forgiving
you and I give up our seat
I am time to decay you bloom
day every every hour
I think I'm getting used to seeing off
coming death anniversary
try to guess their boundaries
and where am I sending death fate
in battle or on a journey in the wave
or the neighboring valley
my accept the cooled ashes
and even though the body is insensitive
equally decay everywhere
but close to the sweet limit
I still want to rest
and let the entrance to the grave
be young play life
and indifferent nature
beauty eternal shine
Caucasus under I am alone in height
stand over the snow at the edge of the rapids
eagle from distant rise top
hover motionless with me on par
from here on i see the birth stream
and the first terrible collapse of the movement
here the cloud humbly go under me
through they cascade down to make noise waterfall
beneath them is a naked cliff mass
there is low moss, skinny bushes, dry
and there is already a grove of green canopy
where the bird chirps where the deer jumps
and there people already nest in the mountains
and the sheep crawl along the lush rapids
and the shepherd descends to the merry valley
where the Aragva rushes to the shady shore
and the beggar rider hides in the gorge
where terek play fierce fun
play and howl like a young beast
see food from cage iron
and to beat on the shore in enmity is useless
and lick the cliff hungry wave
in vain there is neither food nor joy
he presses menacingly the silent mass
to crumble against the dark rock
make noise and foam shaft
and I have to shout eagle
and the forest grumbles
and shine among the wavy haze
top of the mountain
from there it breaks down once a collapse
and fall with a heavy crash
and the whole gorge between the rocks
block
and the Terek can shaft
stop
suddenly become exhausted and subdued
oh terek you interrupt your roar
but the back wave is stubborn anger
break through the snow
you flood become furious
your shore
and it will take a long time to break through the collapse
unmelted pile lying
and the evil Terek runs under him
and dust water
and noisy foam irrigate
ice vault
and go along the wide, silent path
and the horse gallops and the wolf is drawn
and there is your own camel
steppe merchant
where now only aeolus rushes
sky tenant
shootout for the hill
look at the camp they and ours
on the hill in front of the Cossacks
curl red delibash
Delibash don't go near lava
to regret one's life
in a moment amen dashing fun
to be speared
Hey Cossack, don't rush into battle
delibash at all speeds
cut off the saber curve
a dashing head with a shoulder
rush to collide in a general cry
see what it's like
Delibash is already at its peak
and the Cossack is headless
high above the family mountain
Kazbek your royal tent
shine an eternal ray
your monastery is behind the cloud
how the ark flies in the sky
hover barely visible above the mountain
distant coveted shore
there b would say forgive the gorge
rise to the free heights
there to the heavenly cell
I am hiding in the neighborhood of God
between the mountains the Terek wall
the wave sharpens the wild shore
seethe around a huge rock
here and there the road needs to be dug
roar and howl like a living beast
and suddenly calm down and become meek
all lower lower to fall
he was already running away barely alive
so after the storm to be exhausted
a stream of rain flows
and now to get naked
its siliceous bed
scary and boring
there is a housewarming party here
route and overnight stay
cramped and stuffy
into the wild gorge
cloud and snow
the sky is barely visible
like from prison
wind make noise
the sun is offensive
my insect collection
open for my friend
what a motley family
for them wherever I dig I
but what a sorting
here is clay ladybug
here is Kachenovsky's evil spider
here is the Russian pig beetle
here is a black ant
here is a tiny little bug
where do they gather a lot?
neatly behind glass and in a frame
they pierce right through
stand in a row on the epigram
when is your young summer
disgrace noisy rumor
and you are on the verdict of the world
to lose the right to honor
one among the crowd cold
I share your suffering
and for you the prayer is fruitless
idol unfeeling pray
but the light is cruel condemnation
he will not change his
he does not punish error
but the secret to demand for them
worthy equal contempt
his vain love
and hypocritical persecution
prepare your heart for oblivion
do not drink the poisonous swill
leave a shiny, stuffy circle
leave crazy fun
you alone remain friend
It is in vain to see a mistake here
hand art to guide
on the marble this lips smile
and anger at the cold gloss of the forehead
it is not for nothing that this face is bilingual
such shall this ruler be
to counter feeling habitual
in the face and in life harlequin
to lose language and mind at once
look at you with one eye
single eye in my head
when fate would want that
if only I had a hundred eyes
then everything would look at you
what's in your name my
it dies like a sad noise
wave splash on distant shore
like a night sound in a deaf forest
it's on a memorial sheet
leave a dead trace like that
pattern inscription gravestone
into an incomprehensible language
that in the silent one has long forgotten
in the excitement of the new and rebellious
your soul does not give it
memory pure tender
but on the day there is sadness in silence
he pronounces he yearns
say be memory of me
be in the world heart where to live i
I will let you know about my oracle
not according to the patterned variegation
this unsigned scribble
but the wit is cheerful
but the greeting is sly
but with evil mockery
and for such an unjust reproach
and this beauty is alive
with melancholy involuntary with admiration
I reread you
and exclaim with impatience
time to go to moscow to moscow now
here the city is prim and dull
here we are talking about ice heart granite
there is no frivolity here dear
neither muse nor fresh nor harith
in an hour of fun or idle boredom
I used to be my lyre
to entrust a pampered sound
madness laziness and passion
but even then the string is deceitful
I involuntarily interrupt the ringing
when your voice is majestic
I suddenly strike
I pour stream get off unexpected
and my conscience is wounded
your speech is fragrant
joyful clean to be spruce
and now from the spiritual heights
I stretch out my hand to you
and the power of the meek and loving
tame a wild dream
your fire soul burn
reject the darkness of earthly vanity
and listen to the harp of the seraphim
into sacred horror poet
no i don't cherish rebellious pleasure
rapture sensual madness frenzy
lamentation cry bacchante young
when the snake hangs in my embrace
passionate impulse caress and ulcer kiss
she rushes the last moment shudder
oh how sweet you are my humble one
oh how painfully you are happy i
when to bow down for a long prayer
you indulge I am tender without rapture
my shy-cold delight
barely answer not listen nothing
and then become more and more animated
and finally share my flame against my will
stern dant does not despise sonnet
in the silent heat of love petrarch pour out
game he love creator macbeth
they mourn thought camoes clothe
and in our day he captivates the poet

when far from the bustle of the world

from the top sharp look around
look at the bright meadow
look at the blue vault of heaven
and to the Dnieper bank
crowned thicket woody
immovable build he stand
and move your sensitive ear
but he trembled suddenly
it's scary to touch it
he stretched his neck and suddenly
from the top to jump
free the world from the northern shackles
only on the field the marshmallows begin to flow and breathe
as soon as the first linden tree turns green
to you, friendly descendant of Aristippus
I will come to you to see this palace
where is the architect's compass, palette and chisel
scientist your whim to obey
and inspired to compete in magic
you understand life goal happy person

there all the young armidas rejoice
to fun luxury sign first serve
not knowing that fate is doomed
frolic windy yard surround
do you remember trianon and noisy fun
but you do not languish from their sweet poison
teaching becomes your idol for a time
you will retire for your harsh feast
sometimes a worshipper of providence, sometimes a skeptic, sometimes an atheist
diderot sits down on his shaky tripod
throw a wig close your eyes in delight
and preach and humbly you listen
for the cup slow afey or deist
like a curious Scythian Athenian sophist
but london calls your attention your gaze

oh nega that land where the sky is always clear
where life lazy pass voluptuous

where does the wife go out on the balcony in the evening

and you worry about flying to Seville

there the laurels sway, there the oranges ripen
oh well, I can tell you how a wife can do that
with love piety touchingly combine
from under the mantilla a conditional sign to give
say how to fall a letter from behind bars
how to lull golden supervision sullen aunt
say how at twenty years old a lover under the window
tremble and boil envelop in a cloak
everything has changed you see whirlwind storm
fall all union mind and fury
freedom to erect a terrible law
under the guillotine Versailles and Trianon
and the dark horror is replaced by fun
the world will be transformed by the new thunder of glory

and the caustic Beaumarchais and your noseless Kast
all all already pass their opinion talk passion
forget for another look around you
everything new boils the past and burns away
witness be yesterday fall
the younger generation barely comes to its senses
the cruel experience of picking late fruit
they are in a hurry to reduce expenses to income
they have no time to joke, they have lunch at temir
or argue about the verse the sound of a new wonderful lyre
sound lyre byron entertain barely they can
one and the same you step over your threshold
I'm suddenly transported to the day of Catherine
book depository idol and painting
and the slender garden I testify
that you favor the muse in silence
that they in idleness you breathe noble
I listen to you, your conversation is free
fulfill youth influence beauty
you feel alive with delight appreciate you
and the brilliance of Alyabyev and the charm of Goncharov
carelessly surround Correggio Canova
you do not participate in the excitement of the world
it's time to look mockingly out the window at them
and see the rotation in all circles
so the whirlwind forgets business for the muse and idle bliss
in the shade of a porphyry bath and a marble chamber
the Roman nobleman meets his sunset
and from afar they are either a warrior or an orator
sometimes a young consul, sometimes a gloomy dictator
be there for a day or two to relax luxuriously
sigh about the pier and set off again
bless the housewarming
where is your home idol
you transfer and he has fun
free labor and sweet peace
you are happy you have your little house
custom wisdom to keep
from evil care and laziness sluggish
insure against fire
when in my embrace
I will conclude your slender figure
and speech tender love
you are lavishing with delight
silent from constrained hand
free your flexible camp
you answer dear friend
I am distrustful smile
diligently preserve in memory
betrayal sad legend
you are without participation and attention
I listen sadly
curse treacherous effort
My criminal youth
and the meeting is conditional expectation
into the garden into the silence of the night
curse speech love whisper
verse mysterious chant
and the caress is a gullible maiden
and they are tears and late murmurs
poet does not value the love of the people
enthusiastic praise pass minute noise
hear the court fool and the crowd laugh cold
but you remain firm, calm and sullen
you are the king to live alone the road is free
go where you are drawn free mind
improve the fruit of the beloved thought
do not demand a reward for a noble deed
they are in yourself you yourself your high court
all strict to be able to evaluate your work
are you a satisfied or a demanding artist
he's happy, so let the crowd scold him
and spit on the altar where your fire burns
and in childish playfulness shake your tripod
not many painting old master
I always want to decorate my home
so that superstitiously it marvels at the visitor
listen important judgment expert
in a simple corner my midst slow work
one picture i wish to be forever a spectator
one so that I with canvas as with a cloud
most pure and our divine savior
she with greatness he with intelligence in an eye
look meekly into the glory and into the ray

in the middle of an unknown plain

the whole road is covered
at least there is no trace of killing visible
we get confused what to do we
in the field we drive the devil, you can see

now push into the ravine
wild horse
there is an incredible mile there
he's sticking out in front of me
there he will flash a small spark
and disappear into the empty darkness
rush cloud swirl cloud
invisible moon
illuminate the flying snow
cloudy sky night cloudy
power we no spin share
the bell suddenly fell silent
the horse becomes what is there in the field
who are they to know, a stump or a wolf
blizzard is angry blizzard is crying
the horse is sensitive to snore
he has a long way to go
only the eye burns in the darkness
the horse bolted again

in the middle of the white plain
endless ugly

I break my heart
crazy year fading fun
I feel like I have a vague hangover
but like wine the sorrow of the past day
in my soul the older the stronger
my path is sad, I promise labor and grief
the coming to disturb the sea
but not want to die for each other
I want to live to think and suffer
and I know I will be a pleasure
between grief, care and worry
it's time to revel in harmony again
tears flow over fiction
and be able to be sad at my sunset
shine love smile farewell
oh whoever you are whose gentle singing
welcome my to blissful rebirth
whose hidden hand I firmly hand shake
show the way and give the staff
oh whoever you are, an old man or an inspired one
or is youth my distant comrade
or the youth mysteriously keeps the muse
or the floor is a meek, bashful cherub
thank you, my soul is touched

I am no stranger to goodwill
and I'm strange he has a friendly language
funny participation who demand from light
cold crowd gaze at poet
as if he was a visiting buffoon
to deeply express a heavy hearted groan
and suffer through a piercingly sad verse
hit the heart with an unknown force
she should hit the palm and praise or is it time
unfavorable nod head
Does the singer experience sudden excitement?
loss sorrowful exile imprisonment
it's good to say art lover
then it's good to gain new thoughts and feelings
and we pass them on but happiness is a poet
between them they do not find a warm greeting
when afraid to remain silent it
the longed-for moment is approaching to finish my long-term work
why does this incomprehensible sadness secretly disturb me?
or do I perform my feat and stand like an unnecessary day laborer
fee accept your own alien work other
or I'm sorry, work, silent companion, night

deaf deaf call to court judge deaf
deaf scream my he drive cow

the judge decides so that there is no debauchery
marry well done even though the girl is guilty
for the last time your image is cute
dare to caress mentally

you are a poet for yourself
grave twilight dress
and for you your friend to fade away
take the same distant friend
farewell my heart
how to widow a spouse
how to hug a friend silently
before his imprisonment
I will soon be fifteen years old
Will the happy day come?
as he moves forward I move
but even now no one can throw
look at me with disdain
I'm not a boy anymore, I'm over my lip
I can pinch my mustache
I am important like a toothless old man
you hear my voice rough
try who am i push
I like the lady because I am modest
and between them there will be one
and her proud gaze is so languid
and the color of her cheeks is so dark
that life I'm cute she
She is strict and power-hungry
I myself am amazed at her intelligence
and it's terribly jealous she is
but still proud
and I am the only one available
In the evening she I majestically
swear that if there is again
look left and right
then give she I poison right
this is what her love is like
She is ready even in the desert
run away from me despise rumor
want to know my goddess
My Seville Countess
no, don't call me for anything
