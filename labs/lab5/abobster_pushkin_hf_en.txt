That's what happened to me too
What kind of bird is Cupid
The passionate heart was captivated
I confess I am in love too
The time of happiness has flown by
How not knowing the burden of love
I lived and sang
As in the theatre and at balls
At festivities or in vauxhalls
I flew like a light marshmallow
How to laugh at Cupid's evil
I wrote a cartoon
To the dear female sex
But I laughed in vain
Finally I got caught myself
Unfortunately I myself have gone crazy
Laughter liberty everything under the bench
I resign from Cato
And now I am Celadon
The pretty priestess Talia
I saw Natalia's charms
And already in the heart Cupid
So Natalia I confess
I am full of you
I'm still embarrassed for the first time
In love with feminine charms
All day long no matter how I turn
I'm only busy with you
The night will come and only you
I see in empty dreams
I see you in light clothing
As if she were cute with me
Timidly sweet breathing
The swaying of the white breast
Snow eclipsed by whiteness
And the eyes are half open
The humble darkness of the silent night
My spirit is delighted
I am alone in the gazebo with her
I see a virgin lily
I tremble I languish I grow dumb
And I woke up and saw darkness
Around the lonely bed
I let out a deep sigh
Lazy languid sleep
Flying away on wings
Passion becomes stronger
And tired of love
I'm getting weaker every hour
The mind always strives for something
And why should any of us
He won't say that out loud to the ladies
And he'll smear it this way and that
I'll explain myself in a friendly manner
All lovers wish
And what they don't know
I am amazed at this property of theirs
Wrapped in a robe
With a dashing hat on his side
I wish Philemon
In the evening there is shadow everywhere
Taking Anyuta's gentle hand
Explain love's torment
Say she's mine
I would like Nazaroy
You tried me
Hold with a tender gaze
Or the gray-haired Guardian
Easy sweet Rosina
An old stepson of fate
In an epancha and with a wig
With a daring fiery hand
Snow-white full breasts
I wish I could with my foot
You can't step over the sea
And even though I'm head over heels in love
But separated from you
I am deprived of all hope
But Natalia you don't know
Who is your gentle Celadon
You don't understand yet
Why doesn't he dare
And hope Natalia
Listen to me again
I am not the owner of the Seraglio
I am neither a black nor a Turk
For a polite Chinese man
Rude American
You can't honor me
Don't imagine me as a German
With a cap on her hair
With a mug filled with beer
And with a cigarette in his teeth
Don't introduce the cavalry guard
In a helmet with a long sword
I don't like the sound of abusive thunder
Sword sabre halberd
My hands are not weighed down
For Adam's sins
Who are you chatterbox in love
Look at the walls of the sublime
Where there is eternal darkness of silence
Look at the windows they are barred
The lamps are lit there
Know Natalia I am a monk
I want to sing like an unclean spirit of Hell
Saddled was a bearded old man
How he got hold of the black hood
How he pushed the Monk of Sinners into the herd
The singer of love of Ferney old man
To you Voltaire I now turn
Where did your bow go
Which I admire in Jean d'Arc
Where is your brush tell me forever
No man will find them
Voltaire Sultan of French Parnassus
I don't want to saddle Pegasus' horse
I don't want to make ladies out of the muses
But just give me your golden lyre
I will be known to the whole world with her
You frown and say I won't let you
And you are a poet cursed by Apollo
The one who stained the walls of taverns
Under Helikon fallen into the mud with Vilion
Can you help me Barkov
With a smile you give me the violin
You promise wine and a muse half a maiden
Just follow my example
No no I won't take the violins from Barkov
I will sing whatever comes to mind
Let it flow verse by verse somehow
Not far from those beautiful places
Where the impudent Ivan the Great rose up
On his head he wears a golden cross
In the wilderness of the forests in the desert of the gloomy wild
There was a monastery within its deaf walls
In his old age one gray-haired monk
He was saved by prayers and a holy life
And the days calmly approached their end
Our worker was not very rich
He couldn't go to hell for his pomp
Had a cat had a psalter and a rosary
A cowl a sticharion and a bottle of green vodka
Having entered the house where the Monk lived peacefully
You wouldn't see mountains of gold
It would not be marble that would seduce your gaze there
There was no Raphael hanging on the walls
You should see a chair with three legs
Yes in the corner there is a bench half an arshin high
On which the Monk slept and had breakfast
There the down jacket did not swell above the bench
Although he was not a monk he was not rolling in fluff
Between two sheets on soft mattresses
The holy father fasted all year round
He spent all day long in his cell
Have mercy on me he read in a low voice
El slept soundly and prayed every hour
And you are a rebellious Jesuit monk
Blush now if you can blush
If you have even a drop of conscience
Blush and you rich Carmelite
And you resident of the Pechersk Lavra be ashamed
The humble master of hearts and souls
But the lyre stands still it has carried far away
I am already zealous against the cassocks
It's not our job to annoy priests
Pankraty lived happily in solitude
I hoped to see paradise soon
But not a single unknown land
It cannot protect us from the devil
And in those places where the black Satan is
Under guard he gnaws his claws with anger
We suddenly found out that it was fenced off
The road to the monasteries is free
And suddenly all the devils rose up in a crowd
They flew through the air on wings
Another to Paris to the bald Carthusians
He climbed with kopecks and chervonets
That one to the Vatican to the pot-bellied Italians
Burgundy and macaroni carried
That girl fell down with the prelate
He went to the nuns as a young man
And I heard that it was as if the old priest
With one foot already in the coffin
He married two young people in front of the lectern
The devil came running with a whole swarm of Cupids
And suddenly the deacon on the wing snored
The priest fell silent and looked at the girl
And the girl looked at the deacon
The groom's blood began to boil
And the demon led them all to hell
The dark night was already rising in the sky
The daily noise in the cities has already died down
The moon shone through the monk's window
With all his mind directed to the prayer book
Pankraty our Nikolay before the icon
With sighs he bowed to the ground
Molok came that's the devil's name
Pankratia hid under the black duckweed
The Holy Monk prayed and prayed
I sighed and sighed and the devil was right there
The hour strikes Milk doesn't want to let go
Beats two beats three the unclean one still sits
You'll be mine he grumbles to himself
And our old man has already stopped crossing himself
He sat down on the bench rubbed his eyes and yawned
He stretched out three times in prayer
I yawned again and almost fell asleep
However no Pankraty suddenly woke up
And again the demon tempts the Monk
To put Bobrov to sleep I started reading
The monk was bored The monk was amazed
He never yawned as if he were praying to God
But there is no strength left for the crosses the psalter the words
The gray head has forgotten everything
Like an apple rolling down my chest
The hand dropped from the forehead to the knees
The prayer book fell from his hands under the table
The saint dozed off and snored like an old ox
Unhappy sleeper Pankraty suddenly woke up
He looked back and forth with fear
He crosses himself and gets up from his bed
Looks around the lamp is burnt out
A slightly weak light shines around itself
Something in the corner seemed to turn white
The monk is walking and he sees a skirt
What am I seeing or is it just a dream
The monk cried out dumbfounded and turning pale
How is it that I don’t dare continue
As if rooted to the spot in front of the white skirt
He was silent blushing embarrassed trembling
There is only one obstacle to the fire of love
Lover's sweetest reward
And the only cover of charms
Oh skirt I address my speech to you
I dedicate these lines to you
Enliven my pen love
I love you oh skirt dear
When they were waiting for me in the evening
Natalia took off her brocade sarafan
Only a thin figure will surround you
What could be sweeter than you then
And you curling around beautiful legs
The streams of the streams are more transparent and brighter
You touch those places where the young god
Rests between the rose and the lily
Or how Philo ran after Chloe
He strives to hug her
The green bush suddenly held you back
She should stop in shame
But it was too late for Philo to catch up with her
With her he falls on the fragrant grass
And the trembling hand is fiery
Happy Shepherd in Love
It lifts you quietly over the edge
She grins at him with a languid gaze
And he no I don’t dare continue
I tremble and my heart beats strongly
And maybe readers who knows
And your blood flows with the desire of passion
But our Monk was talking about the skirt
Not like me I'm young and not cut my hair
And I am not at all offended by happiness
He wasn't happy to see the skirt
And at that very moment he realized and guessed
That he fell into the clutches of the unclean one
While the night has not yet departed
For now the moon was still shining
The skirt was still visible
How soon the firmament was illuminated by dawn
She suddenly disappeared from view
And our Monk alas is deprived of peace
He doesn't sleep and doesn't pet the cat
He doesn't remember the church service
Pankraty is in trouble from all sides
How does he think when he and the dogs
There is no spirit in the monastery
When I've never seen a skirt here before
Who could have brought her to my house
It seems to me that the lord forgives me for that
Is there a girl here I'm afraid to say
The monk blushed and did not know what to do
I searched in all the corners under the benches
All in vain the old man is left with nothing
But all day long he dragged around like a pale shadow
I didn't eat I didn't drink I didn't sleep peacefully
The day passes and evening comes
I lit lamps and candles everywhere
The Monk is already removing the cowl from his head
I went to bed but just now the rays
The moon from the sky let him through the window
And suddenly the skirt on the bench was illuminated
The alarmed Monk closed his eyes
And so as not to somehow fall into temptation
I wanted to lose my sight forever
Just so I don't look at the skirt
The old man groaned and rolled over onto his side
And wrapped himself warmly in a sheet
He closed his eyes fell asleep and began to snore
At that moment Molok suddenly turned into a fly
And flew to buzz around him
Flew flew circled around the room
And he sat on my monk's nose
He started to seduce Pankraty again
The monk snores and sees a wonderful dream
It seemed to him that in the middle of the valley
He stands among the flowers under the myrtle
Around him there is a host of Satyrs and Fauns
Another laughingly pours foam of wine into a cup
Green ivy on black hair
And grapes hanging on the head
And a light firth lying at his feet
Everything says that the eternally youthful Bacchus
The god of fun is the patron of satyr
Another blowing of the shepherd's pipe
Sings love and the master of hearts
His cheerful trill inspired him
There they dance in a circle under the linden trees
Crowds of children and young men and women
And further branches under the dark vault
In the dense shade of spreading trees
On a bed of roses inflamed with love
Barely breathing with joy exhausted
Amidst joys and sweet coolness
The lovers lie embracing
The monk looked at everything with a troubled eye
Then he turned his gaze to the glass
The monk looked at the girls with a sigh
He scratched his bald forehead with annoyance
Standing like a stump with his mouth wide open
And suddenly I felt courage in my soul
And infuriatedly I’ll pull my hood down on my side
Into the green forest like a white-whiskered page
How a light horse chased a girl
Faster than the eagle faster than the sound of the lyre
The beauty flew like a marshmallow
But our Monk Aeolus seemed before her
Without rest he chased after the new Daphne
I won't let you miss the ring I grumbled
But the goblin suddenly flashed from behind a bush
Pankraty grabs his face with a skirt
And suddenly the pleasant view of the forest disappeared
He does not see the streams of hills and Nymphs
There are no more Fauns Cupid has also flown up
And there is no trace of the lovely beauty
A monk alone in the deep unknown steppe
The sky darkens with a frowning gaze
Suddenly thunder struck the monk
Pankraty Ah and suddenly he woke up
He turns his confused gaze everywhere
In the sky like sapphires of grief
The east was already blushing with dawn
And there is no skirt Pankraty stood up and washed himself
And after praying he began to cry loudly
He sat under the window and grieved bitterly
Ah he thought why you were angry
What is the Lord guilty of before you
How the unclean one twists me as a sinner
I don't want to sleep I want to pray to you
I'll take the psalter and then suddenly a skirt
I want to take a nap and fall asleep at night
What am I dreaming about My spirit is confused
Hear my earnest prayer
Lord do not let me fall into temptation
God heard the old man's prayer
And his mind was enlightened in a moment
From a poor gray-haired simpleton
Pankraty suddenly transformed into Newton
I thought about it looked at it compared it figured it out
And in his joy he overturned his chair
And how the sage saved Syracuse
A barefoot and naked man ran down the street
He was delighted with his discovery
And he shouted loudly to everyone he found it he found it
Well he thought it was from demons and skirts
I'll get rid of you and the lovely girls
I won't be tempted in my dreams anymore
I will live as a monk again
I will wait the last hour with fear
And with faith everything will go well
This is how he thought and he was very wrong
Mighty Rock of the Universe Lord
He played with Pankraty like a doll
The monk filled his jug with water
Muttered words of prayer over him
And was ready for the terrible battles of hell
He is waiting for a skirt from his side
The evil spirit was at work all day
And all in the heat in the dirt in the dust and sweat
The rising moon hurried to warn
Oh why is nature so wonderful to me
Correggio did not give art
Then I would be among the Parnassian people
I was not carried away by a dashing passion
I wouldn't stain my fingers with ink
Don't litter the attic with paper
And at the desk like a girl at a hoop
I would never sit down to write poetry
I would take the brushes with a tremulous hand
And having drunk a glass of champagne in an instant
I would work with a hot head
Like Cician or the fiery Alban
I would like to imagine all the charms of Natalia
I would let a strand of hair fall down to my full chest
Around the head is a wreath of fragrant roses
Around the lovely legs the clothes of Talia are more playful
The camp embraced Cypriots with a golden belt
And with a brush I would be a hundred times happier
Or I would take paints from Vernet or Poussin
The canvas would flow like a river wave
To the sky of the scorching southern countries
Raising the night with a thoughtful moon
I would imagine over a grey cliff
Around which the noisy ocean beats
High walls covered with moss
And there in the waves where the breeze breathes
On the silver around the rocks of glittering foam
The shuttle swayed by marshmallows
I would draw Kantemir in it
Her beauty and I would be glad to throw the lyre
Moving away from the pure muses forever
But I was not born Rubens
I didn't start drawing I started weaving rhymes
Let Martynov captivate us with his brush
And I climbed Parnassus again
Filled with heroic courage
I take the inkwell and paper again
And I will continue singing songs again
What is gray-haired Pankraty doing now
What does his shaggy enemy do
Phoebus has already stopped illuminating the earth
Shadows are already flying in from all sides
The fog hid the view of the groves and forests
Here and there the stars are already shining
The moon already flashed through the forests
Neither alive nor dead he sits under the icons
The monk praying with both hands
And suddenly white as newly fallen snow
Moscow River on the rocky shore
How lightly the shadow appeared in the eyes of the skirt
The monk stands up like a flame reddened
How lovely the lips of the charming fashionistas are
He grabbed the jug all ablaze with anger
And he pours all the water on the skirt
Oh miracle in an instant this ghost disappears
And here before him with horns and a tail
Like a grey wolf covered in bristles
Like a good horse with a shod hoof
Molok appeared trembling under the table
From head to toe covered in water
Covering herself with the hem of her epancha
He rolled his eyes like lanterns in the night
"Hurray!" the monk cried with an evil grin
The underground sorcerer caught you
You are my villain you won't escape now
You'll pay for all your pranks with your head
Come into the bottle I'll seal you up
Now I'll throw her into the well
Aha Mamon you tremble before me
You have won venerable old man
Thus answered Molok very humbly
You win but be generous
Don't drown me in rotten water
I will forever obey you for that
Eat calmly sleep calmly at night
I won't tempt you in any way
That's all right that's all right get into the bottle
I won't leave you alone my friend
After all I haven’t forgotten all your tricks
Forgive me you will be pleased with me
All riches will flow to you like a river
As Bankova I will let you into the know
I'll get you a house and buy you carriages
Poets will come to your front room
I'll make everyone bow to the rich man
I’ll take off my hood and comb my hair in fashion
Having exchanged everything for a long tailcoat with trousers
You will gallop and be proud of the stallions
People laughingly crush with wheels
And to amaze everyone with the English carriage
You'll go sweat at Shilovsky's
Dozing off during dinner at Gorchakov's
To straighten Naryshkina's vest
Then all the nobility with ministers and princes
After all you will live as if with blood friends
You will invite me to your sumptuous dinner
If you don't tempt me I won't leave you
Without further ado go to the bottle right now
Wait wait my dear wait
I will bring you wives and beautiful maidens
The damned demon is in my hands
You dared to think about wives
Look at this he's a worker from hell
You won't seduce Pankraty with vanity
For everything about everything the reward is ready
Repent evil servant of the devil
Give me a minute to talk to you
Leave me alone don't be my enemy
This act will probably be rewarded
And I'll take you to Jerusalem
At these words the Monk did not remember himself
In Jerusalem marveling at the demon he said
Yes yes I'll take you to Jerusalem
Well if so I will save you
Old man old man don't listen to Milk
Leave him leave Jerusalem
The devil is just trying to get a hold of the saint
Don't form a close friendship with him
But you don't listen to me Pankraty
You take a saddle you take a saddle cloth a bridle
The damned devil is already invigorated under you
Getting ready for one hell of a ride
Fly old man sitting on the shoulders of Milk
Push him in the ass and in the sides
Fly hurry to the sacred city of the East
But remember that it is not for a mule
You laid your venerable feet
Keep always keep to the straight road
After all the road to dark Hell is wide
Aristus and you in the crowd of servants of Parnassus
You want to ride the stubborn Pegasus
You are rushing along a dangerous path for laurels
And with strict criticism you boldly enter into battle
Arist believe me leave the pen and ink
Forget the streams the forests the sad graves
Don't burn with love in cold songs
To avoid falling off the mountain go down quickly
There are and will be enough poets without you
They will be printed and the whole world will forget
Perhaps now I am moving away from the noise
And united forever with the stupid muse
Under the peaceful shadow of Minerva's aegis
Another father of the second Telemachis is hidden
Fear the fate of senseless singers
Killing us with the mass of poems
The tribute of the late descendants to the poets is just
There are laurels on Pindus but there are also nettles there
Fear disgrace What is Apollo
Hearing that you also climbed Helikon
Shaking his curly head with disdain
Your genius will reward you with a saving vine
But why are you frowning and ready to answer
Perhaps you will tell me not to waste unnecessary words
Once I decide on something I don’t back down
And know that my lot has fallen I choose the lyre
Let the whole world judge me as it wants
Get angry shout swear but I'm still a poet
Arist is not the poet who can weave rhymes
And he doesn’t spare the papers he squeaks with his pens
Good poetry is not easy to write
How Wittgenstein defeated the French
Meanwhile Dmitriev Derzhavin Lomonosov
Immortal singers and honor and glory of the Russians
They nourish the healthy mind and teach us together
How many books perish before they are born
Loud creations by Rifmatova Grafova
With heavy Bibrus they rot at Glazunov's
No one will remember them and no one will read their nonsense
And the seal of Phoebus' curse is on them
Let's assume that we have happily climbed Pindus
You can rightly call yourself a poet
Everyone will be happy to read you then
But do you think that they are already flowing to you like a river
For being a poet you are given untold riches
What are you already taking at the mercy of the state
You bury your gold coins in iron chests
And lying on your side you eat and sleep peacefully
Not so dear friend writers are rich
Fate did not give them marble chambers
The chests are not filled with pure gold
A shack underground high attics
Here are their magnificent palaces magnificent halls
Poets are praised by everyone but only magazines feed them
The wheel of fortune rolls past them
Born naked and naked enters the coffin Rousseau
Camoes shares his bed with the beggars
Kostrov dies unknown in the attic
By alien hands he was betrayed to the grave
Their life is a series of sorrows thundering glory sleep
You seem to have thought a little now
What are you saying judging everyone so harshly
Going through everything like a new Juvenal
You talked to me about poetry
And he himself quarreled with the Parnassian sisters
I came here to preach in verse
What happened to you Are you sane or not
Arist without further ado here is my answer to you
In the village I remember with simple laymen
The priest is elderly and has grey curls
In peace with neighbors he lived in honor and contentment
And he was considered the first sage by everyone for a long time
Once having drained the bottles and glasses
He was walking home from the wedding towards evening a little drunk
He came across some men
Listen father the simpletons said
Teach us sinners you forbid us to drink
You always command everyone to be sober
And we believe you but what about today
Listen the priest said to the men
Do as I teach you in church
Live well and don't imitate me
And I had to answer the same thing
I don't want to justify myself in the least
Happy is he who does not feel the desire for poetry
Spends a quiet life without grief and without worries
He doesn't burden magazines with his odes
And he doesn’t sit over impromptu performances for weeks
He doesn't like to walk on the heights of Parnassus
He does not seek pure muses or ardent Pegasus
Ramakov is not afraid of him with a pen in his hand
He is calm and cheerful Aristo does not drink
But stop arguing I'm afraid I'll bore you
And to torment you with a satirical pen
Now my dear friend I have given you advice
Will you leave the flute and fall silent or not
Think about everything and choose any one
To be nice is good and calm is twice as good
Quick Source Kalomoni
Running to distant shores
I see your troubled waves
A muddy stream over the rocks
In the glitter of the night stars they sparkle
Through the dormant deserted forest
They make noise and water the roots
Trees intertwined in a dark roof
Your mossy shore was loved by Kolna
When the shadow poured across the sky
You matured when you were involuntarily in love
Here Kolna gave herself to her friend
In the halls of Selma the king of the mighty
He spoke to the young Toscar
Walk into the darkness of the dense forests
Where Krona rolls a black shaft
Cooled by the rustling aspen
There is a row of graves there
There with a faithful brave squad
I have scattered the enemy regiments
And many many strong fell
A black raven guards their coffins
Come and where they were not
Erect a monument to victories
He said and set off on an unknown distant journey
Toskar set out with the bards
Walks in the gloom of the sad night
In the evening chill in the midday heat
The red morning star brings out
Golden morning in the sky
And now Toskar is approaching
To places where in dark forests
The grey spring of Krona runs
And it hides in the sleepy valley
The bards sang the holy hymn
Toskar is a fragment of the flint mountains
With a strong powerful hand
Draws from the abyss of silver waves
And with noise on the high bank
Into the thick and wild grain he plunged
He hung black armor on it
Sword covered in the blood of ancestors
And a round shield and a feathered helmet
And he addressed the stone with a speech
Speak son of the noisy stream
About the brave late times
Yes at that terrible hour how deep the night is
In the fog it will lie across the forests
Dear stranger tired
Lying down under a safe shelter
Will remember distant centuries
In the sweet dream of light dreams
With the dawn of the scarlet morning star
Awakened by the rays of the sun
He will see the dark tombs
And struck by a menacing appearance
The foreign son asks
Who erected the arrogant monument
And the old man is bent over with age
Our unforgettable Toskar speaks
Hero of bygone times
The eternal inhabitant of heaven has disappeared
The dawn has faded in the sky
Moon in the air abode
Hurrying on dark clouds
It's already night on the hill of the Krona bank
Fell asleep with the surrounding grove
Lord of mighty Kalomonas
Foreign friend Karul
Summoned the Morven Hero
In Kolny's dwelling the young
Taste the pleasantness of peace
And drink from a circular cup
Near the ashes everyone sat down
The bards sang a song of joy
And in the foam a golden cup
Steeply rushes in succession
Only Laura's alien is sad
He bowed his head to his chest
Thoughtfully he has passionate looks
He aimed at the tender Kolna
And his chest sighs heavily
The sparkle in the eyes of joy has faded
Then fire runs through the limbs
The spirit languishes with bliss
Secretly feeling longing
There is a strong excitement in the blood
Looking at the youthful charms
He drinks a full cup of love
But now the oak tree has stopped smoking
And the shadow becomes darker
The dim sky darkens
And sleep reigns in the chambers
The night thins out the crimson dawn
Kindled by the rays of the sun
Before her the golden firmament is rosy
Toskar left his bed of sleep
Fast-flowing Calomonas
Walks along the wet banks
Hurries to see the valleys of the Crown
And listens to the splashing waves
And suddenly from the shadow of a dark grove
As at midnight in spring
From the clouds the golden moon
A young warrior comes out
The sharp sword shines on the hip
The spear arms the right hand
Pulled over the forehead with a helmet
And the flexible figure is covered with a shield
The dawn's armor turns silver
Through the morning steam in the valley
O young warrior of the rivers Toskar
What enemy will you fight
Is there really a war in this country too
The crimson streams of the waves
But everything is calm and quiet
The area around the dwelling of the gentle Kolna
The wilds of Kalomona are calm
The golden land of the fatherland is blooming
But Kolna doesn't live there
And now along the deaf path
The desert flows with the sweetheart
Captivating the heart with beauty
What did you say to me young warrior
Where did the kidnapper hide
Give me your shield and Toskar
Accepts the shield blazing with vengeance
But suddenly the heroic glow disappeared
What he sees with sweet admiration
Unable to sigh in passion
Suddenly ablaze with new delight
Lileina bared her breasts
Under the menacing breathing cover
Is it you who cried out hero
And with a trembling hand
He takes off his shiny helmet from his head
And Kolna sees before him
In the distance you see a lonely cliff
The caves in it were dug deep
The entrance surrounded by bushes darkens
Nearby a wave is roaring and foaming
In the evening when the moon was foggy
Here she called upon dear Evleg
Here a quiet voice was transmitted to the mountains
In the darkness of the night sad and alone
Come Odulf the grove has already turned pale
I sat down on the wild moss to wait for Odulf
The chest burns breath after breath flies
Oh how sweet it is to live my friend soul to soul
Come Odulf I will forget myself with you
And the kiss will burn with love
Run Osgar your gaze is terrible to me
Your appearance is menacing and your conversations are cold
Leave me alone do not rejoice over me
Another one is already dozing with me at night
Already at dawn another embraces me
And his kiss is sweet to me
Why does he delay in fulfilling my hopes
For my dear I threw off my clothes
An envious cover lies at the feet
But look this is my gentle friend
The raptures of tender passion have already begun
And the kiss will burn with love
Odulf walks with rapture in his eyes
There is love in the chest and sadness runs away
But near him in the darkness steel flashed
And he shuddered a suspicion was born
Who did you ask why you are here
Answer me O son of the gloomy night
Powerless enemy of Osgar run away
In the desert darkness what timid eyes seek
Fear me I am inflamed with passion
In the cave here Eilega is waiting for Osgar
The damask sword is drawn in a minute
Fire flies in streams from the impact
Evleg heard the clash of swords
And with fear she abandoned the cold of the cave
Come and see the object of your love
Odulf cried out to his tender faithful friend
You call him a traitor here
In the darkness of the night you are delighted with bliss
But you will find the bold in Valhalla
He raised his sword and with trembling Evleg
Falls on the turf like a flying wisp of snow
Torn from the rocks by a blizzard
The rivals are aiming at each other
A bloody current ran through the stones
They roll into the bushes in despair
The last voice of Evlegu called
And the cold of death fettered their fury
On the gravestones in the midnight mists
Stepping tremblingly with a tired foot
The traveler walked along the Lora in vain his eyes languid
They looked for a peaceful place to spend the night in the thick darkness
There is no cave before him on the gloomy shore
Doesn't see the fisherman's hut heritage
In the distance the dense forest is shaken by the winds with noise
The moon is behind the clouds and the dawn sleeps in the sea
It goes on a rock covered with wet moss
The old bard sees the joy of past years
With his grey brow bowed over the howling stream
In the silence of time he contemplated the flight
A jagged sword hung on the branch of a gloomy willow
The thoughtful singer turned his quiet gaze
To the son of foreign lands and the fearful traveler
He shuddered in horror and hurried past
Stop traveler stop said the singer of centuries past
Here the brave fell almost their battle ashes
Almost the heroism of the children of the grave asleep in sleep
The stranger's head drooped and it seemed that he was on the hills
The risen row of shadows of the head is bloody
With a proud smile he inclined his head towards the wanderer
Whose coffin I see there the foreigner said
And he pointed to the shore with his staff for the bard
A quiver and a steel helmet nailed to the cliff
They cast a dim ray golden as the moon
Alas here fell the inspired elder Osgar River
About the early youth the last hour came
But he was looking for him I saw him as in a military formation
He awaited the first arrows with joy
And he broke from the ranks and fell in the raging battle
Rest in peace young man you fell in glorious battle
In the prime of his tender years Osgar loved Malvina
More than once he met joyfully with his girlfriend
Evening moonlight sliding over the valley
And the shadow that fell from the menacing seaside cliffs
It seemed like their hearts were on fire for each other
Osgar Malvina breathed alone
But the days of love and happiness quickly flew by
And the evening of sorrow came for the young man
Once upon a dark night in the sometimes dreary winter
Osgar knocks on the door of a young beauty
And the young friend whispers don’t linger here your dear
But it's quiet in the hut Again with a timid hand
Knocks and listens only to the whistling winds blowing
Are you really sleeping now Malvina There is darkness all around
Snow is falling hair is freezing in the fog
Hear hear me Malvina dear friend
He knocks for the third time with a creak and the door wobbles
He enters with trepidation What did the unfortunate man see
His gaze darkened Malvina shuddered
He sees in the arms of the traitor Zvignel
And wild rage boiled in his eyes
The young lover grows dumb and trembles
He drew his formidable sword and Zvignel was no more
And his pale spirit hid in the darkness of the night
Malvina hugged the unfortunate knee
But turning away his gaze Osgar spoke live
Live already I am not yours I despise betrayal
I will forget I will extinguish the heat of unfaithful passion
And he quietly walks out the door in silence
Shackled by dark silent melancholy
The sweet charm has disappeared forever
He is alone in the world his soulmate is gone
I saw a young man with his head down
He whispered Malvina's name in despair
Like the twilight dozing over the sea abyss
The darkness of despondency lay on the sorrowful heart
He glanced hastily at his childhood friend
The already motionless gaze of friends did not recognize
Removed from the feasts in the silent desert
He fed his sadness with loneliness
And Osgar spent a long year in torment
Suddenly the trumpet sounded Oden's son Fingal
Led the formidable ones to swords in the bloody heat of battles
Osgar heard the news and was filled with swearing
Here his sword flashed and death fled before him
Covered with wounds he fell here on a pile of bodies
He fell his hand still searching around the sword
And the deep sleep of centuries fell upon the strong
The enemies fled back and the hero found a quiet world
And everything is quiet around the burial mound
Only in the cold monthless autumn
When the mountain tops are weighed down by damp darkness
In a crimson cloud covered in fog
A sad shadow sits over the gravestone
And the arrows rattle the armor and quiver knock
And the maple tree stirring makes a mysterious noise
Young Daphnis chasing Doris
Wait shouted lovely wait
Say I love you and run after you
I will not swear by Cyprida
Shut up shut up Reason spoke
And the rogue Eros tell me you are dear to my heart
You are dear to my heart shepherdess repeated
And their hearts lit up with the fire of love
And he fell at the feet of the beautiful Daphnis
And Doris lowered her passionate gaze
Run run her mind kept telling her
And the rogue Eros said Stay
Remained with a trembling hand
The happy shepherd took her hand
Look said the dove with his girlfriend
There they embraced under the thick shade of the linden trees
Run run Reason repeated
Learn from them Eros told her
And a gentle smile ran across
Beauties on fiery lips
And here she is with longing in her eyes
She fell into the arms of her beloved
Be happy Eros whispered to her
Reason why Reason has already been silent
You want a priceless friend
So that I am a young poet
I talked to you
And with a forgotten lyre
Inspired by dreams
Left the monastery
And the land is secluded
Where is the continuous world
Into the darkness descended
And in the deep desert
Silently reigned
With gloomy silence
And like a swift arrow
I'll rush to the Neva bank
I'll hug my friend
My golden spring
And as a singer of Lyudmila
Dreams are my dear slave
Having ascended under the paternal roof
I'm not bringing you gold
I am a poor monk
A bunch of poems as a gift
Secretly entering the sofa
At least with the help of a pen
Oh how I will catch you
Dear sister
What do you do with your heart
In the evening time
Do you read Jean-Jacques
Is Zhanis in front of you
Or with the frisky Hamilton
You laugh with all your heart
Or with Gray and Thomson
You were transported by a dream
Into the fields where from the oak grove
A breeze blows into the valley
And the curly forest whispers
And the majestic one rushes
From the top of the mountains a stream
Or an old dog
I've turned grey in the pillows
Wrapped in a long shawl
And cherishing with tenderness
You call Morpheus to her
Or do you look into the dark distance
Pensive Svetlana
Above the noisy Neva
Or a sonorous piano
Under a fleeting hand
You bring Mozart to life
Or are you repeating the tones
Piccini and Rameau
But now I'm with you
And in silent joy
Your friend's soul has blossomed
Like a clear spring day
The days of separation are forgotten
Days of sorrow and boredom
The shadow of sadness has disappeared
But this is just a dream
Alas in the monastery
In the pale glow of the candles
I write to my sister alone
All is quiet in the gloomy cell
Latch on the doors
Silence is the enemy of fun
And boredom on the clock
The chair is old and unupholstered
And a shaky bed
A vessel filled with water
Straw pipe
That's all that's in front of me
I see awakened
Fantasy with you
I was awarded one
Carried by you
To the magical Hippocrene
And in my cell I am blessed
What would have happened to me
Goddess without you
Familiar with the hustle and bustle
Pleasant for me
Carried away by fate
I'm suddenly in blank walls
Like Lety on the banks
He appeared as a prisoner
Buried forever
And the gates closed
Closing behind me
And the beauty of the world
Dressed in black darkness
Since then I have been looking at the light
Like a prisoner from a dungeon
To the bright shine of the morning star
Will the light of day rise
Throwing a gilded beam
Through a narrow window
But the heart is darkened
It doesn't make me happy
Or at a late time
Like a ray of light in the sky
Covered in blackness
It's getting dark in the clouds
I meet it with despondency
I am a dark shadow
And I see you off with a sigh
Hiding Day
I look through the bars through tears
Counting the beads
But time will pass
And from the stone gates
The locks will fall they will fall
And to the magnificent Petrograd
Through the valleys of the mountains
The zealous ones will come running
Rushing to the housewarming party
I will leave the dark cell
Fields gardens their own
Under the table is a hood with a chain
And I will fly back as a defrocked monk
Into your arms
Is it possible that instead of roses planted by Cupid
Tulips proudly bowed
Fragrant lilies of the valley jasmine and lilies
Which you always loved
And before every day I wore it
On your marble chest
Is it possible dear Climene
What a strange change in taste
You love to smell not the morning flower
And the harmful grass is green
Transformed by art
Into fluffy powder
Let him already be a grey-haired professor of Göttingen
On the old pulpit bent over in an arc
Having fixed his mind on the deep Latin language
Coughing powdered tobacco
He pokes his long nose with his withered hand
Let the young dragoon have a moustache
Sitting by the window in the morning
With the rest of the morning sleep
A greyish smoke comes out of the meerschaum pipe
Let the beauty be sixty years old
Graces on vacation and love in retirement
Which holds all the charm on the stand
There is no place on the body without wrinkles
Backbites prays yawns
And with faithful tobacco he forgets sorrows
And you are lovely but if it's tobacco
You like it so much the heat of imagination
Ah if turned to dust
And in a snuffbox in confinement
I could fall into your gentle fingers
Then in heartfelt admiration
Scattered on the chest under a silk scarf
And it may even be But that dream is empty
This will never happen
Destiny is envious and evil
Oh why am I not tobacco
Arist promised us such a tragedy
That everyone in the theater will start crying with pity
That the tears of the audience will flow like a river
We were waiting for a golden drama
So what have we waited for and have nothing to say
Her dignity cannot be diminished
Well Aristo managed to write right
A very pathetic piece
Once upon a time at midnight
Through the fog and darkness
He rode quietly over the river
The daring Cossack
The hat on the bekren is black
The whole zhupan is covered in dust
Pistols on the knee
Sabre to the ground
The faithful horse does not feel the bridle
He walked in step
Waves the long mane
He went deeper into the distance
There are two or three huts in front of him
The fence is broken down
Here is the road to the village
There in the dense forest
I won't find a girl in the forest
Denis thought he had a grip
The beauties are already in the chambers
We cleaned up for the night
The Donets moved the bridle
I made fun of him with a spur
And the horse rushed off like an arrow
I turned towards the huts
The moon has silvered in the clouds
Distant skies
She sits sadly under the window
Beautiful maiden
The brave man sees the red maiden
The heart beats in it
The horse quietly to the left to the left
It's right under the window
The night is getting darker
The moon has disappeared
Come out soon my dear
Give the horse a drink
No to the young man
It's scary to approach
I'm afraid to leave the house
Give the horse some water
Oh the girl must be beautiful
Become friends with your sweetheart
The night is dangerous for beauties
Joy do not be afraid
Believe me my darling it's empty
Cast aside false fear
You are wasting your golden time
She's a sweetheart I bet
Sit on the greyhound with you
I'm going to a distant land
You will be happy with me
With a friend everywhere is paradise
Why did the maiden bend over
Conquered fear
She timidly agreed to go
The Cossack became happy
Let's jump and fly
A friend loved his friend
I was faithful to her for two weeks
The third one changed
Even without knowing Apollo
Poet court philosopher
With respect to the noble nobleman
Offers an ode of two hundred stanzas
But I am dear Gorchakov
I don't wake up with the roosters
And with pompous verses
A set of thunderous words
I can't sing empty songs
High subtle and cunning
And I don’t dare turn it into a lyre
My goose feather
No no dear prince I will not ode
I intend to dedicate it to you
What came to stick your nose into the water
At first without asking for help
And soar in Derzhavin's wake
I write in my own style now
Somehow poems for a name day
What should I say at this hour
To wish a friend from the bottom of my heart
How deep is your old age dear prince
Children dear wife
Or the riches of loud days
Crosses of diamond stars of honor
Wouldn't it be nice to wish for glory
You were carried away on a bloody path
To shine in laurels and crowns
So that thunder can be thrown from your hands in battles
And may victory be yours
As in ancient times to the Nevsky hero
Always flew after everywhere
Not a poet of lust
Congratulate with such a song
He would rather leave the muses forever
May God grant you love throughout your life
Epicurus' gentle pet
Spent between Bacchus and Cupid
And there when the Stygian coast
Flashes in the misty distance
God grant that in passionate rapture
You with languid sweetness in your eyes
From the hands of young Cupid
Entering the dark chalon of Charon
Fell asleep on Ershova's breasts
Who will win in a minute
Love with a cold mind
The burden of oppressive shackles
It won't put it on her wings
Let him not laugh let him not frolic
Be friends with strict wisdom
But you will argue with reason again
Even if you're not happy you'll open the door
Like the mischievous Eros
Knock on the gate
I experienced it myself
The truth of these right words
Goodbye forgive me love
For the blind goddess
I'm not flying for Chloe
Happiness I'll grab happiness
I thought in my mad pride
Suddenly I heard loud laughter
Eros also looked back
Knocked on the gate
No I don't think I'll have to
To live in discord with this God
And for now the thread of life
Old Parka is spinning there
Let him own me
Having fun is my law
Death will open the terrible coffin
Clear eyes will darken
And Eros will not knock
At the grave gates
In the dark shady grove
Where the murmur in the fragrant grass
A bright stream wanders
At night on a simple flute
The shepherd in love sang
The languid hum of a sad trill
Repeated in the wilderness of the valleys
Suddenly from the depths of the cave
The Reader of Bacchus and Venus
Master of the Frisky Fauns
Ermiev's son ran out
The horns are entwined with roses
Ivy on black hair
Goat fur filled with wine
On Satyr's shoulders
The god of the forests bowed in an arc
Above the crooked stick
Hiding behind the bushes
I listened to the night songs
Shaking his head in tune
Days passed in joy
The young shepherd sang in melancholy
Why did it become a dream
You disappeared like a shadow from my eyes
And were covered in eternal darkness
Ah when in the darkness of the night
Under the mysterious moon
Into the dark shadow of a cool grove
Sweetly sleeping in silence
Slowly hand to hand
Came with gentle Chloe
Who could compare with me
I was nice to Chloe then
And now life is a grave for me
The white light is hateful to the soul
The forest is sad the stream is gloomy
Chloe cheated on her friend
I'm no longer sweet to my sweetheart
The sound of the quiet flute disappeared
The singer fell silent and there was silence
Reigned in the wild grove
The only sound you can hear is the splashing of the waves
And the dodder sways
A quietly blowing zephyr
The trees left a thick canopy
Suddenly a Satyr appears
A circular cup of friendship
With foamy silver wine
River with a grinning face
You are sad your heart is gloomy
Look how clear the juice is
Shines when illuminated by the moon
Drink the cup with your soul
You will be just as pure and clear
Believe me groaning in troubles is in vain
Better have fun
In grief be friends with Bacchus
And the shepherd took the cup in his hands
Soon he drank it all to the bottom
About the power of wine
Suddenly the sorrows and torments disappeared
The darkness of the soul disappeared in an instant
He only raised the vial to his lips
Everything changed instantly
All nature came to life
The young man is happy in his dreams
Having drunk the golden cup
He pours another one
He's already drinking his third but in his eyes
The surrounding view became dark
And the unfortunate man got tired
Bowing my languid head
Teach me Satyr
The shepherd says with a sigh
How can I fight fate
How can I be happy
I can't drink forever
Listen dear young man
Here's some useful advice for you
Catch a moment of bliss forever
Remember the instructions of friendship
There is no fun here without wine
There is no happiness without love
Well now go and have a hangover
Make peace with Cupid
Forget his grievances
And in the arms of Dorida
Enjoy happiness again
Here is my mirror take it Cypris
The goddess of beauty will be beautiful forever
In the gray time she is not afraid of the insult
She is not a mortal person
But I'm submitting to fate
Unable to see myself in the transparency of glass
Not the one I was
None of the ones that exist now
Withers withers summer is red
Clear days fly away
A stormy fog is creeping in
Nights in the slumbering shadows
The fields of grain have become empty
A cool playful stream
The curly forest has turned grey
The vault of heaven turned pale
Svet-Natasha where are you now
That no one sees you
Or don't you want a single hour
To share hearts with a friend
Not over the wavy lake
Not under the fragrant shelter of linden trees
Early late at night
I'm not dating you
Winter cold is coming soon
The grove will visit the field
A light in a smoky hut
It will soon shine brightly
I won't see the lovely one
And like a goldfinch in a cramped cage
I'll grieve at home
And remember Natasha
Friends the leisure time has come
All is quiet all is at peace
More like a tablecloth and a glass
Here comes the golden wine
Fizz champagne in a glass
Friends what about Canton
Seneca Tacitus on the table
Folio on folio
Under the table of cold sages
We will take control of the field
Under the table of learned fools
We can drink without them
Will we really find a sober one
Behind the student's tablecloth
Just in case we'll choose
More like a president
As a reward he will pour some for the drunks
And punch and fragrant grog
And the Spartans will bring you
A glass of clean water
Apostle of bliss and coolness
My good Galich
Be healthy
You are Epicurus' younger brother
Your soul is in a glass
Cover your head with wreaths
Be our president
And the kings themselves will become
Envy the students
Give me your hand Delvig why are you sleeping
Wake up sleepy sloth
You are not sitting under the pulpit
Put to sleep by Latin
Look here at your circle of friends
The bottle is filled with wine
Drink to the health of our Muse
Parnassian red tape
The witty fellow is kind to the hands
Fill your glass with leisure
And pour out a hundred epigrams
On the enemy and on the friend
And you are a handsome young man
The illustrious rake
You will be the dashing priest of Bacchus
For other things the veil
Although I'm a student although I'm drunk
But I respect modesty
Move the foamy glass closer
I bless you for battle
Comrade dear friend direct
Let's shake our hand
Let's leave it in a circular bowl
Pedants are akin to boredom
This is not the first time we drink together
We often quarrel
But let's pour the cup of friendship
And we will make peace immediately
And you who have been since childhood
You breathe only joy
You are a funny poet aren't you
Even though you write bad fables
I shuffle with you without ranks
I love you with my soul
Fill your mug to the brim
God bless you reason
And you are the rake of rakes
Born for mischief
Daring grip thug
A bosom friend
We'll break bottles and glasses
For Platov's health
Let's pour punch into the Cossack's hat
And let's drink again
Come closer our dear singer
Beloved by Apollo
Sing to the ruler of hearts
Guitars ringing quietly
How sweet it is in a tight chest
The languor of sounds flows
But should I sigh with passion
No a drunk just laughs
Isn't it better to have a note-taking Rode
In honor of the Vakhova Stanitsa
Now you will squeak the string
The Disturbed Violinist
Sing in chorus gentlemen
There is no need that it is awkward
Hoarseness is not a problem
For drunks everything is fine
But what I see is all together
The bottle of arak doubles
The whole room went round
The eyes were covered with darkness
Where are you comrades where am I
Say for Bacchus sake
You are dozing my friends
Leaning over the notebooks
The writer for his sins
You look the most sober of all
Wilhelm read your poems
So that I can fall asleep sooner
Often often I talked
With the chatterbox of the Hellenic country
And he did not dare to speak in a hoarse voice
With Chapelin and with Rifmatov
To sing the praises of the heroes of the north
The Incomparable Virgil
I read and reread
Without trying to imitate him
In tender feelings and harmony
I analyzed the German Klopstock
And he could not understand the wise man
I didn't want to sing like him
I want to be understood
Everyone from small to great
Behind Milton and Camões
I was afraid to fly without wings
I did not dare to write meaningless verses
Roast the cherubs with cannons
To live in paradise with Satan
Or the Holy Mother of God
Together to praise Aphrodite
I have never been a sinner
But yesterday there was a swarm in the archives
I found a nice book
Golden unforgettable
Catechism of Wit
In a word Jeanne of Orleans
I read it and was delighted
I sing about the prince Bova
Oh Voltaire oh my only husband
You which in France
They revered him as some kind of god
In Rome the devil is the antichrist
A monkey in Saxony
You who are on Radishchev
He glanced at me with a smile
Be my Muse now
I also intended to sing
But can I compare with Radishchev
I don't remember how many years later
After the birth of the Savior
Tsar Dadon reigned with glory
In Svetomir the strong city
Tsar Dadon crown with scepter
It wasn't direct that I got it on the road
But having killed the legitimate king
Bendokira the Feeble-minded
This is how loyal subjects used to be
They glorified their kings
If kings are careless
Not in bed and not at night
Slept with the chamberlains
Tsar Dadon is not feebleminded
He was worthy of the evil nickname
But the tyrant is sleepless
Although by the way he didn't have it
I'm too lazy to appreciate all his virtues
And show you the vices
Have you heard good people
About the king that twenty whole years
He didn't take off his weapon
He didn't get off his spirited horse
Flew everywhere with victory
The baptized world was drowned in blood
He did not spare even the unbaptized
And cast down into nothingness
Alexander the terrible angel
Spends his life in humiliation
And forgotten by all is called
Now Elba is the emperor
This is what Tsar Dadon was like
Once the bearded men gathered together
Dadon didn't like the Beardless
On the throne saddened
He gave them this speech
You who give advice
The weight of the scepter has been lightened
Sweetened the king's fate
She was not bitter to him
Wise friends and companions
I decide to resort to you
What should I do now Listen
Everyone stood up frowning importantly
They bowed low and low
And straightening my mustache and beard
They sat down on oak benches
You know Dadon continued
What is art and untruth
I have reached the shaky throne
Bendokira the Feeble-minded
Mated with Militrisa
To the sweet wife Bendokirova
And he put Bova in prison
Prince of the blood son of the king
It was easier to capture
The golden crown of the feebleminded
Than putting a crown on the head
Keep him for yourself
This people is already senseless
Walking the streets on holidays
We talked among ourselves more than once
May God help the prince
After all Bova is not little anymore
Don't hit your father with your head
There is no need to be behind bars
He is dangerous to my plans
What should I do with him tell me
Shouldn't we leave him in prison
The whole assembly became thoughtful
Everyone looked down in silence
That's right golden advice
We weren't chatting here we were thinking
Arzamor is an old experienced husband
He opened his mouth to advise
The gray-haired man wanted to know
He groaned loudly but came to his senses
And in silence he bit his tongue
Putting a finger carefully to the forehead
The glorious physician grandson of Aesculapius
Eseldorf shaved Swabian yawned
He scribbled with a snuffbox
But he kept silent about his wisdom
He didn't show it in front of everyone
Vikhromakh Polkan with Dubynia
The guards of the throne are glorious knights
Everyone sat as if rooted to the spot
Thunderstorm is known for its power
But the mind is not perceptive
I thought and thought and accidentally
He dozed off and started snoring in the corner
Which example works better
What moves people more strongly
Here they yawned under the glove
Brave Mirozhar with Ivashka
And Polkan and Arzamor are gray
And they bowed to the chest
Quietly with wild heads
Look Dadon dozed off the council
The multi-thinkers began to snore
The advisers had a long sleep
If the German hadn't had to
Drop the snuffbox on the floor
The snuffbox rolled
And suddenly she hit the spur
Thunderstorm of the sound asleep
It thundered and split into two
Flew off in different directions
The brave warrior awakens
Looks around the entire meeting
Meanwhile the tobacco crumbled
It rises to the knight's nose
And the hero sneezed with annoyance
So the vaults shake
The windows are all shaking and crumbling
And the doors slam on their hinges
The assembly awakens
What is there to think about the hero shouted
You don't need King Bova
Well to hell with the prince
It was decided that he would not live
Later brothers you will judge
How should we deal with him
That's how the brave warriors ended
Speeches are loved to be laconic
Okay we'll listen to you
The king said stretching
Tomorrow we will see each other
Now go home everyone
Dadon made a mistake with the delay
He didn't recite the alphabet correctly
Don't put it off until tomorrow
What can you accomplish today
All the courtiers dispersed
Meanwhile the night was already getting darker
Tsar Dadon in the royal bed
Together with my sweet wife I lay down
With the incomparable Militrisa
But he turned his back to her
This night to his majesty
I didn't want to play I wanted to sleep
Militrisina's little maid
Zoya is a young girl
Angel with a face of gaze
With a white hand and a gentle foot
Taking off the silk dress from the lady
Skirt cap ribbon lace
I hid everything under the key in the chest of drawers
And she quietly went to the girls' room
There she undressed herself
I raised the window with difficulty
And she lay down in a downy bed
Waiting for a dear friend
Svetozar the Tsar's Page
He promised to come by dark night
Jump out of the window into her room
The red maiden waits and waits
No just like there is no dear friend
Chu strikes midnight what about Zoyinka
He sees them entering her window
Who is the friend of the tender heart
No that's not it at all readers
Sees a shadow or a ghost of the old
A crowned head with a long hat
In a robe instead of a mantle
Belted with a washcloth
The view of an innocent bulging gaze
The mouth is open the teeth are bared
Long donkey ears
They clap loudly over their shoulders
Zoya sees and trembles
The readers will find out
Bendokira the Feeble-minded
Trembling full of confusion
Zoyinka knelt down
Connected handle to handle
She lowered her clear eyes
I read it in a quick whisper
What I could never learn
Our Father and the Mother of God
And she said quietly
What do I see oh my god
O Nikola Sava the Martyr
Overshadow the defenseless
Is this you our father the Tsar
Why did you leave tell me
Now is the kingdom of heaven
Lighting up with stupid laughter
The shadow was advertising to the beautiful Zoyinka
Zoya Zoya don't be afraid my light
I don't want to scare you
I didn't come here for that
From the other world as a ghost
It's fun to scare living people
But can I have fun
Is there a son of Bendokirov
Dear Tsarevich Bova
They'll roast you on the fire tomorrow
The poor king began to cry pitifully
The kind girl felt pain
How can I help you please
I obey you in everything
This is what I want Zoyinka
Rescue your son from prison
And she herself went into a gloomy dwelling
Sit in the prince's place
May you suffer for the innocent
I bow down to you very low
And I will say thank you Zoyinka
Zoyinka became thoughtful here
To sit in a dark hole for thanks
It seemed harsh to her
But having tender feelings
Zoya secretly agreed
To such a proposal
So you are right oracle of France
Saying that wives are weak
Against the arrows of the young Eros
Everyone has a good soul
The heart is tender and unfeigned
But tell me O beloved king
Zoya said to the deceased
How can I well judge for yourself
Rush into the dark dungeon
Where your dear son grieves
Fifty select warriors
They guard him day and night
Am I a weak timid woman
To deceive their keen eyes
Rest assured there will be a chance
Just swear my dear
Do not reject this opportunity
If he introduces himself to you
I swear said the girl
The ghost disappeared in an instant
Quickly flying out of the window
Zoyinka sighed quietly
I lowered the window here
And calming down in bed
Soon soon I will fall asleep
A lively philosopher and poet
Parnassian Lucky Sloth
Harit the pampered favorite
Confidant of the dear Aonids
Mail on a golden-stringed harp
The singer of joy fell silent
Are you a young dreamer too
Finally broke up with Phoebus
Already with a wreath of fragrant roses
Between the golden curls
Under the shade of branchy poplars
In the circle of young beauties
Don't knock on the glass for a toast
Love and Bacchus are not to be sung
Pleased with the happy beginning
You don't pick the Parnassian flowers again
Our Russian Guys are not heard
Sing young man Singer of Tiisskaya
You were influenced by your gentle spirit
Your lovely friend is with you
Lileta is the joy of red days
Love is the reward of the singer of love
Tune the lyre to the strings
Fly with playful fingers
Like spring Zephyr by colors
And with voluptuous verses
And in a quiet whisper of love
Invite Liletu to your hut
And the night stars in the pale light
Floating in the distant heights
In a secluded office
Listening to the magical silence
Tears of happiness fill the beautiful breast
Lucky dear water
But intoxicated with passionate love
And don't forget the gentle muses
There is no more love or happiness in the world
Love her and sing her on the lyre
When can I come to you at my leisure
Friends and acquaintances will gather
And the foaming wine will flow
Freed from captivity with a bang
Describe in playful verses
Fun noise chatty guests
Around the set table
A glass boiling with white foam
And the sound of shining glass
And the guests sang a cheerful verse together
Glass to glass hitting in harmony
They will repeat in a discordant chorus
Poet In your will objects
Boldly strike the sonorous strings
Sing a bloody battle with Zhukovsky
And death is threatening on the battlefield
And you met her in formation
And you are beset by fate
How Ross Became a Pet of Fame
You fell with a cold scythe
The one that was barely mown did not wither
Or inspired by Juvenal
Arm yourself with the sting of satire
Take her whistle sometimes
Smite the vice
Show something funny while joking
And is it possible to fix us
But leave Trediakovsky
In the peace that is so often destroyed
Alas it's enough without him
Let's find the meaningless poets
There are enough objects in the world
Pens worthy of yours
But what about my pipe
An unknown poet in the world
I don't dare continue the song
Sorry but remember my advice
As long as you are loved by the muses
You Pierid are burning with fire
Until struck by an invisible arrow
You won't go down to the underground house
Forget the sorrows of the world
Play you young Nazon
Eros and the Graces were married
And Apollo built the lyre
And you dear friend left
A safe haven of silence
He directed his shuttle merrily
In the moisture of the stormy depths
Fate has already leaned on the steering wheel
The skies shine calmly
The winged boat set off
Happiness will straighten the sails
God grant that there will be no severe weather
You haven't seen horror up close
So that the stormy whirlwind does not blow up
The waters are noisy in front of the boat
God grant that we reach the shores in the evening
May you land safely
And relax peacefully there
Inseparable from love and friendship
No you can't forget them
But what can't happen soon
I will see you my friend
A secluded hut in silence
Around the punch bowl
Sometimes you remember me
When will I go to the housewarming party
To fall asleep is the common lot of all
Say God grant him joy
At least he knew how to love in life
The veil of gloomy night hung over
On the vault of the sleeping skies
The valley and groves rested in silent silence
In the gray fog the distant forest
You can barely hear a stream running into the shade of an oak grove
The breeze barely breathes as it falls asleep on the leaves
And the quiet moon is like a majestic swan
Floating in silver clouds
Floats and pale rays
The objects were illuminated all around
Avenues of ancient linden trees opened up before the eyes
We glimpsed both the hill and the meadow
Here I see a young willow intertwined with a poplar
And reflected in the crystal clear waters
The queen flowed proudly among the fields
Blooms in luxurious beauty
From the flint hills waterfalls
Flowing down like a river of beads
There in the quiet lake the naiads splash
His lazy wave
And there in the silence are huge chambers
Leaning on the vaults they rush towards the clouds
Was it not here that the earthly gods spent their peaceful days
Isn't it the Temple of Minerva of Russia
Isn't it midnight Elysium
The beautiful Tsarskoe Selo Garden
Where the mighty eagle of Russia rested after slaying the lion
In the bosom of peace and joy
Alas those golden times have passed
When under the scepter of the great wife
Happy Russia was crowned with glory
Blooming under the shelter of silence
Here every step gives birth to a new soul
Memories of past years
Looking around with a sigh Ross speaks
Everything has disappeared The Great No More
And in thought deepened over the greedy banks
Sits in silence bowing his ears to the winds
The past years flash before my eyes
And in quiet admiration the spirit
He sees himself surrounded by waves
Above the hard mossy rock
The monument rose spreading its wings
A young eagle sits above him
And heavy chains and thunderous arrows
Three times the stars twined around the formidable pillar
Around the foothills the grey waves rustle
They lay down in the glittering foam
In the shadow of dense gloomy pines
A simple monument was erected
Oh how degrading is the Kagul shore for you
And glorious to the dear homeland
You are immortal forever O Russian giants
Trained in battles amidst the harsh weather
About you companions friends of Catherine
The rumor will pass from generation to generation
O loud age of military disputes
Witness of the glory of Russians
Have you seen how Orlov Rumyantsev and Suvorov
The formidable descendants of the Slavs
Perun stole Zeus' victory
The world marveled in fear at their brave exploits
Derzhavin and Petrov sang a song to the heroes
With the strings of thunderous lyres
And you rushed by unforgettable
And soon the new century saw
And new battles and military horrors
To suffer is the lot of mortals
A bloody sword flashed in an indomitable hand
By the treachery and audacity of the crowned king
The scourge of the universe has risen and soon a fierce battle
The menacing dawn has broken
And they rushed off in a fast stream
Enemies on Russian fields
Before them the gloomy steppe lies in deep sleep
The earth smokes with blood
And peaceful villages and cities burn in the darkness
And the sky was dressed in a glow around
The dense forests shelter those who flee
And the idle plow rusts in the field
Their strength goes on and there is no obstacle
They destroy everything they turn everything into dust
And the pale shadows of Bellona's fallen children
In the air shelves united
They descend into the dark grave incessantly
Or wander through the forests in the silence of the night
But the clicks were heard they go into the misty distance
The sound of chain mail and swords
Fear the host of foreigners
The sons of Russia have moved
The old and the young are flying on the daring
Their hearts are set on fire with vengeance
Tremble tyrant the hour of your fall is near
You will see a hero in every warrior
Their goal is either to win or to fall in the heat of battle
For the faith for the king
The zealous horses are full of abuse
The valley is dotted with warriors
Line after line flows everyone breathes glory and revenge
Delight passed into their chests
They fly to a terrible feast looking for prey for swords
And behold the battle blazes on the hills thunder rumbles
In the thick air arrows whistle with swords
And blood splashes on the shield
Fought Russian winner
And the arrogant Gaul runs back
But the heavenly Almighty is strong in battles
He crowned it with the last ray
It was not here that the gray-haired warrior struck him down
About the bloody fields of Borodino
You are not the limit of fury and pride
Alas on the towers of the Gall Kremlin
The edges of Moscow are my native edges
Where at the dawn of the blooming years
I spent golden hours of carelessness
Without knowing sorrows and troubles
And you saw them the enemies of my homeland
And you were stained with blood and consumed by flames
And I did not sacrifice my vengeance and life to you
In vain did the spirit burn with anger
Where are you beauty of Moscow with its hundred heads
The beauty of my native land
Where before the city appeared majestic to the eye
The ruins are now alone
Moscow how terrible is your sad face to a Russian
The buildings of nobles and kings have disappeared
All the flames destroyed the crowns of the towers
The rich man's palaces have fallen
And where luxury lived
In shady groves and gardens
Where the myrtle smelled sweet and the linden trembled
There are now coals ashes dust
In the silent hours of a beautiful summer night
Noisy fun won't fly there
The shores and bright groves no longer sparkle in the lights
Everything is dead everything is silent
Comfort yourself mother of Russian cities
Behold the death of the stranger
Today it weighs heavily on their haughty necks
The Avenging Right Hand of the Creator
Look they run to look they don’t dare
Their blood never stops flowing like rivers in the snow
They run and in the darkness of the night they meet hunger and death
And from behind the sword of Ross drives
About whom you trembled
Europe's tribes are strong
O predatory Gauls you too have fallen into the graves
Oh fear oh terrible times
Where are you beloved son and happiness and Bellona
He who despised the voice of truth faith and law
In pride dreaming of overthrowing thrones with the sword
Disappeared like a bad dream in the morning
In Paris Ross where the torch of vengeance
Bow your head Gaul
But what do I see The Hero with a smile of reconciliation
Coming with the golden olive
The thunder of war still rumbles in the distance
Moscow is as despondent as the steppe in the midnight darkness
And he brings salvation to the enemy not death
And beneficial peace to the earth
Worthy grandson of Catherine
Why the heavenly Aonids
As a singer of the Slavic Bard squad of our days
My spirit is not burning with delight
Oh if Apollo were the poet's miraculous gift
I am now impressed in my chest by You
On the lyre he would thunder with heavenly harmony
And shone in the darkness of time
O Skald of Russia inspired
The one who sang the terrible line of warriors
In the circle of your friends with an inflamed soul
Sound the golden harp
Yes once again a harmonious voice will flow in honor of the Hero
And the trembling strings will sprinkle fire into the hearts
And the young warrior will boil and shudder
At the sounds of the warlike Singer
In the evening of a stormy autumn
In distant places the maiden walked
And the secret fruit of unhappy love
Held in trembling hands
Everything was quiet the forest and the mountains
Everything was asleep in the darkness of the night
She has attentive glances
The driver looked around in horror
And on the innocent creation
She sighed and stopped them
You are sleeping my child my torment
You don't know my sorrows
You open your eyes and yearn
You won't cling to my chest
You won't meet a kiss tomorrow
To your unfortunate mother
You will try to entice her in vain
My guilt is an eternal shame to me
You will forget me forever
I will not forget you
Strangers will give you cover
And they will say: You are a stranger to us
You will ask: Where are my relatives
And you won't find your own family
My angel will be a sad thought
Languishing among other children
And to the end with a gloomy soul
Look at the caresses of mothers
Everywhere the lonely wanderer
Cursing the unjust limit
He will hear the cruel reproach
Forgive me then forgive me
Maybe the orphan is sad
When you find out you'll hug your father
Alas where is he dear traitor
My unforgettable until the end
Then console the sufferer of torment
Tell her she doesn't exist
Laura couldn't bear the separation
And threw the desert light
But what I said may be
You will meet the guilty mother
Your sorrowful gaze will disturb me
Is it possible not to recognize the son
Ah if only fate were inexorable
My prayer moved me
But maybe you'll pass by
I have parted with you forever
You sleep let yourself be unhappy
Press to your chest for the last time
The law is unjust and terrible
Condemns us to suffering
Before the summers are driven away
Your carefree joy
Sleep my dear bitter sorrows
The quiet days of childhood will not be touched
But suddenly a light appeared behind the grove
There is a moon near her hut
She grabbed her son with excitement
And she approached her
She leaned down and quietly laid it down
A baby on a stranger's doorstep
She turned her eyes away in fear
And disappeared into the darkness of the night
In the middle of a dark grove under the shade of fragrant linden trees
In the tall reeds where the pearls are often
The foam of the silvery waters swelled
Swaying in a quiet breeze
The shy beauty's veil
Carelessly thrown near the shore lay
And her charms flow like a playful wave
Irrigated with joy
The grove dweller is hasty
Be humble about the stream
Quieter than the talkative streams
Be afraid to change her
Leda trembles with timidity
The snowy chest breathes quietly
Not a wave splashes around
Not a marshmallow dares to blow
The rustling in the grove dies down
All in a lovely silence
The nymph further steps
Timidly trusting in the wave
But something rustled among the coastal bushes
And a feeling of beautiful shyness took hold
I shuddered involuntarily unable to breathe
And here is the king of birds from under the bent willow
Spreading proud wings
A chest full of joy floats to the beauty
With noisy foam he bravely drives the waves
The air beats with wings
Then he twists his neck into rings
Then he bows his proud head humbled before Leda
Leda laughs
Suddenly there is a sound
Joy of clicks
The view is voluptuous
To the beautiful Leda
The swan crouched
You can hear the groaning
Silence again
Nymph of the forests
With sweet tenderness
Sees furtively
The Secret of the Gods
The young beauty finally came to her senses
She opened her quiet gaze sighing in languor
And what did I see on the bed of flowers
She rests in the arms of Zeus
There is young love between them
And the veil of the mystery of the charm fell
Learn from this example
Roses of the Virgin of Beauty
Be afraid on a summer evening
In the dark grove of water
In the dark grove lurks
Often fiery Eros
Rolls down with a cold stream
Arrows are hidden in the foam of the waters
Learn from this example
Roses of the Virgin of Beauty
Be afraid on a summer evening
In the dark grove of water
Have you ever seen a delicate rose
Dear daughter of a clear day
When in spring barely blossoming
She is the image of love
This makes it even more beautiful for our eyes
Now Evdokia has appeared
I have seen spring blossom more than once
Lovely and young like herself
But alas the winds and storms
These fierce children of Winter
Soon I will roar over our heads
They will envelop water earth and air
And there are no more flowers and no more roses
Dear daughter of love
Having withered the barely blossomed one falls
The time of clear days has passed
Evdokia love Time does not wait
Enjoy your lucky days
In cold old age
It is given to us to know the ardor of love
You ask me for my portrait
But painted from life
My dear he will be ready soon
Although in miniature
I am a young rake
While still at school
I'm not stupid I say it without embarrassment
And without affected grimacing
There was never a chatterbox
No Sorbonne doctor
More annoying and louder
Than my own person
My height is the same as the tallest
Cannot be equal
I have a fresh complexion and light brown hair
And a curly head
I love light and its noise
I hate solitude
I hate quarrels and bickering
And partly teaching
I really like the ball performances
And to be honest
I would say that I still love
If I hadn't been at the Lyceum
For all this my dear friend
You can recognize me
Yes the way God created me
I always want to seem like that
A real devil in mischief
A real monkey face
Too much too much frivolity
Yes that's Pushkin
Forgive me my dear friend
Two years of silence
Write you a message
I had no time
Carried on a troika
From the humble homeland
In the great city of Peter
From morning to morning
I've been spinning around for two years
Busy and idle
Yawning was having fun
At the theatre at feasts
I knew no peace
Alas not for an hour
As if at a lectern
On Maundy Thursday
The Exhausted Sexton
But thank God thank God
On a smooth road
I'm out now
Already pushed out the door
Worries and sorrows
Who played
I'm ashamed of myself for so long
And in the holy silence
A lazy philosopher
Far away from the noise
I live in a small town
Happy in obscurity
I rented a bright house
With a sofa and a fireplace
Three simple rooms
There is no gold or bronze in them
And the fabrics are discharged
They don't cover their parquet
Windows into the garden are cheerful
Where the linden trees grow old
They bloom with bird cherry
Where can I go at midday
The vaults of the birches are dark
They give a cool shade
Where the lily of the valley is snow-white
Intertwined with a delicate violet
And a fast stream
Carrying a flower in the streams
Invisible to the eye
Babbling by the fence
Here is your kind poet
Lives well
Doesn't go to fashionable society
On the street of carriages
Doesn't hear the annoying knocking
There is no thunder here at all
Only occasionally a cart
Creaks on the pavement
Or a traveler to my house
Coming to look for a place to stay for the night
With a walking stick
There will be a knock on the gate
Blessed is he who rejoices
In peace without worries
Who is Phoebus secretly friends with
And little Eros
Blessed is he who is in the open space
In a secluded corner
Doesn't think about grief
Walking around in a cap
He drinks and eats whenever he wants
Doesn't bother about the guest
Nobody nobody to him
To be lazy alone
Doesn't interfere in bed
Aonid will want
He calls the crowd to himself
If he wants to sleep soundly he will
Leaning towards Rhyme
And quietly forgetting myself
So I am my dear friend
Now it's settled down
With a crowd of shameless servants
Said goodbye forever
Taking refuge in the office
I'm the only one who doesn't get bored
And often the whole world
I forget with delight
My friends are the dead
Parnassian priests
Standing above the shelf
Under thin taffeta
They live with me
The singers are eloquent
Prose writers are humorous
Things are in order here
Son of Mom and Minerva
Ferney Evil Screamer
The poet among poets is the first
You are the grey-haired naughty boy here
He was raised by Phoebus
Became a poet from childhood
I've read more than anyone else
Less tiring than anyone else
Rival of Euripides
Erata gentle friend
Ariosta Tassa grandson
Father Candida will tell
He is great everywhere
The only old man
On the shelf behind Voltaire
Virgil Tassus with Homer
All together we stand
In the morning leisure hour
I am often apart from each other
I love tearing them off
Pets of the young Graces
With Derzhavin later
Sensitive Horace
There are two of them
And you are a dear singer
With lovely poetry
Captivating hearts
You are the lazy careless one here
The simple-hearted sage
Vanyusha Lafontaine
You are here and Dmitrev is gentle
Your fiction is loving
Found a safe shelter
With Krylov close to you
But here is a dear confidant
Psyche golden-winged
O good Lafontaine
He dared to fight with you
If you can wonder
Look you are defeated
Raised by Cupid
Vergier The Boys with Grecourt
They hid in a corner
They come out more than once
And they take sleep away from the eyes
On a winter evening
Here are Ozerov and Racine
Russo and Karamzin
With Moliere the giant
Von Vizin and Knyazhnin
Behind them frowning is important
Their formidable Aristarchus
Is brave
In sixteen volumes
Even though I'll sing a terrible poem
Laharpe see the taste
But I often admit
I spend time on it
The cemetery was found
On the very bottom shelf
All schoolboy talk
Lying in the dust
Vizgov's writings
The stupidity of psalmody
Famous creations
Alas for the mice alone
Eternal peace and oblivion
Both prose and poetry
But they are protected
You should know this
I hid a secret
Moroccan notebook
This scroll is precious
Preserved for centuries
From a member of the Russian forces
Cousin
Dragoon soldier
I got it for free
You seem to be in doubt
It's not hard to guess
So these are compositions
Those who despised the seal
Praise be to you children of glory
Enemies of the Parnassian Bonds
O prince confidant of the Muses
I love your fun
I love your caustic verse
In your messages
In satire knowledge of the world
And the purity of the syllable
And in the playfulness of the verse
Playful wit
And you are a bold mocker
I got a place in it
Whose whistle is merry in hell
The poets were irritated
Like in my youth
In the waves of misty Lethe
He drowned them en masse
And you are intricate
Buyanova singer
The paintings are so rich
And a sample of taste
And you are a priceless joker
Which Melpomene
Buskins and dagger
Playful Talya gave
Whose brush will paint for me
Whose brush will compose
So original
Here I see with Chernavka
Podshippa sheds tears
Here the Prince trembles under the bench
The whole council is dozing there
In tragic confusion
Captive kings
Forgetting the war battles
They play kubari
But shall I name the fellow
That at times it is good
Half of the notebook
Filled only with myself
O thou heights of Parnassus
Boyar small
But the ardent Pegasus
The daring rider
Scribbled Odes
Attic decoration
They say it from generation to generation
Great Great Svistov
I know how to appreciate your gift
Even though I'm not an expert in law
But I don't dare tell you here
Praises to weave a wreath
In a whistling style
Singing the praises of Whistle
But go away with God
How glad you are to swear that
I won't write
Oh you in my desert
Favorite creators
Borrow from now on
Hours of carelessness
My friend I'm with them all day
Then he is deep in thought
Then with your thoughts
Transferred to Elysium
When at sunset
The last ray of dawn
Drown in bright gold
And the bright kings
Dusk of the night
Floating in the sky
And the groves quietly slumber
And the rustling in the forests
My genius is invisible
Flies above me
And I in the silence of the night
I'm merging my voice
With shepherd's bagpipes
Ah happy happy is he
Who gave the lyre as a gift from Phoebus
In the color of days will take
Like a brave inhabitant of the sky
He will soar to the sun
Will become above mortals
And glory will thunder loudly
The poet is immortal forever
But should I be proud of her
But should I flatter myself with immortality
I am happy to argue until I cry
I'm not betting on it
Who knows maybe I will too
He will put his seal on it
Celestial Apollo
Shining with heavenly light
With a fearless flight
I'll fly to Helikon
I am not all given over to decay
With my shadow perhaps
At midnight
The son of Phoebus is young
My great-grandson is enlightened
He'll come to talk
And inspired by me
He will breathe on the lyre
For now a priceless friend
Lit by the fireplace
I'm sitting under the window
With paper and with a pen
There is no glory before me
But only friendship
I am inspired now
My friend I am happy with her
Why her sister
With young love
I burn in vain
Or golden youth
In vain were roses given to me
And shed tears forever
In the valley where it blossomed
My woeful lot
The singer's dear companion
Dreaming is light-winged
Oh be with me
Give me your hand with sweetness
And with a circular bowl
Lead me to happiness
The path of oblivion
And in the hour of silent night
When the lazy poppy
Will cover languid eyes
On windy wings
Come rush into my cramped house
Knock softly
And in the delightful silence
Hug your pet
Dream in the Magic Canopy
Show me your sweetheart
My light my good genius
The object of my love
And the sparkle of heavenly eyes
Pouring fire into hearts
And the Graces' charming figure
And the snow of her face
Imagine that you are on your knees
Resting with me
In gusty languor
She bowed down
To the chest with passionate chest
Word of mouth
The face of the beautiful one is burning
And tears in the eyes
Why like an invisible arrow
You are already flying into the distance
He will deceive and disappear
The Fugitive Irrevocable
Doesn't hear crying and moaning
And where is the winged dream
The seducer will disappear
And in the heart there is a tormenting sadness
But is everything dear friend
To be in rapture of happiness
And in sadness the languid spirit
Finds pleasure
I love on a summer day
Wandering alone with melancholy
To meet the evening shadow
Over the quiet river
And with a sweet tear
To look into the gloomy distance
I love with my Maron
Under the clear sky
Sit near the lake
Where is the snow-white swan
Leaving the coastal grain
Full of love and bliss
With my friend
Throwing back his neck proudly
Floats in the golden waves
Or for fun
Leaving books to study
In my free time
At the kind old lady's
I drink fragrant tea
I don't go near the handle
I don't shuffle around in front of her
She doesn't squat
But immediately there was no news
He'll talk to me a lot
Collects newspapers
From all sides it is
He will know everything and find out
Who died who is in love
Whose wife is in fashion
Removed with horns
In which garden
The cabbage has given color
Foma his mistress
He punished me for nothing
Antoshka balalaika
Playing broke it
The old lady will tell you everything
Meanwhile she knits a skirt
He's chatting all his stuff
And I sit humbly
Deep in dreams
Without listening to her
On the rhymes of the dashing
So once Svistova
In the capital I listened
When your creations
He read to me with passion
Ah apparently God was torturing
Then my patience
Or my good neighbor
Seventy years old
Dismissed from service
Retired major
He calls me out of friendship
Have some bread and salt with him
Evening feast
The old man became cheerful
Over Grandpa's Mug
In the past delving deeper
With the Ochakov medal
On the wounded chest
He will remember that battle
Where the companies are ahead
Flew to meet glory
But I met the core
And fell on the bloody valley
With a damask sword
My soul is always happy
Spend time with him
But God is to blame
I repent before you
Your servants
I am a city priest
I'm afraid I'm afraid of conversation
And wedding dinners
Then I just can't stand it
What about rural priests
Like the Pope of the Jews
I don't like it at all
And with them the hooked one
The people of the clergy
Rich only in bribes
And the stronghold of snitches
But my friend is there soon
I'll see you
Then we leave grief
Behind the circular bowl
Then I swear by the gods
And I will keep my word
I am with the village priests
I will hold a prayer service
I love it inflamed at midday
Take a refreshing breath from the stream
And in a quiet distant grove
Watch the stream splashing on the shore
When will the wine start to flow to the edges
Foaming in a circular bowl
Friends tell me who isn't crying
With joy in my soul in advance
Cursed be the daring
Who is the first with a sinful hand
Blinded by violent wickedness
O fear mixed wine with water
Cursed be the race of the villain
Let him not be able to drink
Or owning glasses
Distinguish between Lafitte and Tsymlyansky
Everything has passed
It rushed past
Time of love
Passions of torment
In the darkness of oblivion
You disappeared
So I change
I tasted the sweetness
Proud Helen
I forgot the chains
Your heart is in freedom
Forget everything
In this new share
Be happy
Only in spring
Zephyr young
Captivated by the rose
In passionate youth
I was beautiful
I am hooked on the web
No I won't
Henceforth sigh
I will forget the passion
Stop suffering
Soon sorrows
I'll meet you at the end
Oh is it for you
Young singer
The Charm of Elena
Blooms like a rose
Let all the people
Seduced by her
Following the dream
Rushing in a crowd
In a peaceful home
On the ashes
In a simple bowl
I will stand in humility
To draw oblivion
And for friends
With a frisky hand
Move the string
My harp
In boring separation
That's what I dreamed of
In sorrow in torment
I indulged myself
Kindled in the heart
The image of Elena
Thought of exterminating
Last spring
Young Chloe
Decided to love
Like a breeze
Early in the day
The leaf is driven away
With a frisky wave
So incessantly
Inconstant
Played with passion
Lilu Temiru
He adored everyone
Heart and lyre
Dedicated to everyone
What is in vain
From the beautiful chest
I tore off the shawl
Treason is in vain
The image of Elena
There was a fire in my heart
Ah come back
Joy of the eyes
The cold moves
With my sadness
He cries in vain
Poor singer
No he doesn't meet
The torment is over
So until the grave
Sad and despondent
Look for blood
Forgotten by everyone
Entwined with thorns
The chains were dragged
Licinius do you see on a fast chariot
Crowned with laurels in a brilliant crimson robe
Young Vetuliy lounging proudly
It flies along the pavement into the crowd of people
Look how everyone bows their backs before him
How the regiments of lictors drive the unfortunate people
A long line of flatterers senators beauties
With humility they cast him a touching glance
They wait in secret trepidation for the smile of the moving eyes
As if by the wondrous blessing of the gods
And little children and old men with gray hair
Everyone strives for him with both their eyes and souls
And even the tracks of the wheels are imprinted in the mud
As if some kind of monument seemed sacred to them
O Romulan people before whom you fell in the dust
Before whom did you feel such base fear in your soul
The proud Quirites bowed under the yoke
To whom oh heavens to whom were they enslaved
Shall I tell Vetulia to my Fatherland the shame of my
A dissolute youth sat in the council of men
The despot's favorite rules the weak Senate
He stretched a yoke over Rome dishonoring his fatherland
Vetulius the Roman king O shame o times
Or is the universe doomed to destruction
But who is under the portico with his hands behind his back
In a tattered cloak and with a beggar's crutch
He walks with his head down and his brows furrowed
I'm not mistaken I'm a philosopher Damet
Gives where you say in such wretched clothes
Amidst the magnificent Rome you wander along your path
Where I don’t know myself I seek the desert
I don't want to live among debauchery anymore
I see the vices and malice of Iapetus' children
I will leave Rome forever I hate people
Licinius a good friend is he not better than us
Bowing to the dream Fortune to vanities
Learn from the example of the gray stoic
Wouldn't it be better to say goodbye to the city as soon as possible
Where everything is at the mercy of the laws of rightness
And wives and husbands and honor and beauty
Let Glyceria be a young beauty
Equal to all common as a circular cup
Others who are inexperienced in love are caught in the net
We are ashamed to have weaknesses and wrinkles
Love flies from the old man in a crowd of joys
Let the shameless Clitus be the nobleman's slave Cornelius
Leaving the bed of sleep with the rooster crowing
From the noble to the rich they flee from house to house
I am a Roman at heart freedom boils in my chest
The spirit of a great nation does not sleep within me
Licinius let's hurry away from worries
Madmen of pride of deceptive beauties
The tiresome rhetoricians of Parnassus Herostratus
We will bring our father's home to the village
In a shady grove on the seashore
It is not difficult for us to find a beautiful bright house
Where there is no longer any fear of popular unrest
In old age we will rest in the quiet of solitude
And there settling down in a cozy corner
With a fiery oak burning in the fireplace
Remembering the old days behind my grandfather's vial
I will inflame my spirit with Petro Juvenal
In thunderous satire I will depict vice
And I will reveal the morals of these centuries to posterity
O Rome o proud land of depravity and villainy
A terrible day will come the day of vengeance and punishment
I foresee the end of the terrible greatness
The crown of the universe will fall into the dust
Wild peoples sons of fierce warfare
The terrible sword of war took into bloody hands
And the mountains and seas will be left behind
And they will rush at you like a boiling river
Rome will disappear and be covered in deep darkness
And the traveler turned his eye to the piles of stones
He speaks lost in thought and deep in dreams
Rome grew by freedom and was destroyed by slavery
In the caves of Helicon
I was once born
In the name of Apollo
Tibullus baptized
And the bright Hippocrene
Got drunk from childhood
Under the roof of spring roses
I grew up as a poet
The Merry Son of Hermius
I fell in love with the child
In the golden days of playfulness
He gave me a pipe
Getting to know her early
I was whistling incessantly
At least he played without difficulty
But Muzam was not bored
And you are a singer of fun
And a friend of the Permes girls
Do you want fame
Having flown along the path
Saying goodbye to Anacreon
I hurried after Maron
And sang to the sounds of lyres
Wars are a bloody feast
Little was given to me by Phoebus
Hunting is a poor gift
I sing under a foreign sky
Away from home Lar
And with the impudent Icarus
Fear of flying is not in vain
I wander my way
Be as you please
The evening glow was dying out in the depths
Silence hung over the gloomy Elbe
Through the pale clouds quietly ran
Misty Moon
Already in the west gray-haired clothed in darkness
The sky merged with the plain of blue waters
Alone in the darkness of the night above a wild cliff
Napoleon sat
Dark thoughts crowded in the mind of the destroyer
He forged a new chain in Europe's dreams
And raising a gloomy gaze to distant shores
He whispered fiercely
Everything around me fell into a dead sleep
The abyss of stormy waves lay in the fog
Not a frail boat will float out to sea
No hungry beast will howl over the grave
I am here alone full of rebellious thoughts
Oh how soon will I foam under the rudders
I will be carried away by a submissive wave
And the silence of the sleeping waters will be broken
Worry night over the Elbe cliffs
The moon grows darker behind the clouds
There fearless squads await me
They have already come together they are already closed in formation
The world already lies in chains before me
I will come to you through the black depths
And I will strike again with a deadly thunderstorm
And a battle will break out for the Gallic eagles
With a sword in hand victory will fly
The bloody current in the valleys will boil
And I will cast the thrones into the dust with thunder
And I will crush Europe's wondrous shield
But everything around me fell into a dead sleep
The abyss of stormy waves lay in the fog
Not a frail boat will float out to sea
No hungry beast will howl over the grave
I am here alone full of rebellious thoughts
O happiness the evil seducer
And you like a sweet dream disappeared from the eyes
My secret keeper amidst the storms
And a faithful mentor from his youth
How long has it been since the invisible path
You led me to the throne
And hid it with a daring hand
The brow is crowned with laurels
How long has it been since the peoples trembled
They timidly brought me tribute of freedom
Bowing banners of honor
Thunder smoked around me
And glory shines above your head
She rushed covering me with her wing
But a menacing cloud hung over Moscow
And the thunder of vengeance struck
At midnight young king you moved the militia
And death followed the bloody banners
The mighty fall echoed
And peace to the earth and joy to the heavens
And for me shame and imprisonment
And my ringing shield is shattered
The helmet does not shine on the battlefield
In the coastal grain the sword is forgotten
And fades in the fog
And everything is quiet around In the silence of the nights
In vain do I hear the howl of death
And the sound of shining swords
And the furious lamentation of the fallen
Only the splashing waves are heard by the greedy ear
The familiar cries of battles fell silent
The thunder of bloody enmity fades away
And the torch of vengeance went out
But the hour is near the fatal minute is coming
The boat is already flying where the formidable throne is hidden
There is thick darkness all around
And with the gaze of death flashing
A fading mutiny sits on deck
Fear Gaul Europe vengeance vengeance
Weep your scourge has risen and everything will fall to dust
Everything will perish and then in general destruction
I will sit as a king on the tombs
Silenced Dark shadows lay in the sky
And the moon of distant clouds leaving the dark shadows
A trembling weak light poured out to the west
The Eastern Star played in the ocean
And a boat was seen running in the fog
Under the vault of the menacing Elbe rocks
And Gaul the predator has illuminated you
The legitimate kings fled in trembling
But do you see the day fades away the darkness has hidden it
Face of the blazing dawn
Silence spread over the gray abyss
The sky darkens a thunderstorm hangs in the darkness
All is silent trembling destruction is over you
And your lot is still hidden
Dear birthday boy
Oh dear Pushchin
A hermit came to you
With an open soul
Hug the alien
But a good singer
Meet without fuss
From the front porch
He is a guest without etiquette
Doesn't require greetings
Of sly vanity
Accept his kisses
And pure desires
Heartfelt simplicity
Give your guests a feast
On a wax table
Put down the beer mug
And a cup of punch
Old drinking buddy
Let's forget for an hour
Let the mind be the light
Will now go out in us
Let the old man have wings
Flies on mail
The moment of loss is dear to us
In the fun of only one
You are happy my dear friend
In golden tranquility
Your carefree age flows by
Day after day passes
And you are in the conversation of the Graces
Not knowing black troubles
Live like Horace lived
Although not a poet
Under the roof of the poor
You are not familiar at all
With the sinister Hippocrates
With a frowning priest
Can't you see at the threshold
Crowding worries
Found a way to you
Joy and Eros
Do you like the sound of clinking glasses
And the smoke from the pipes is thick
And the demon of metromaniacs
Doesn't rule you
You are happy in this lot
Tell me what is more
I wish my friend
I'll have to shut up
God grant that I am with my friends
Celebrating the hundredth of May
Covered with gray hair
I told you in verse
Here pour me a cup
Have fun until death
Our faithful companion
And let us both die
When full cups knock
Let the gloomy rhymer
Veiled in poppy and nettle
The zealous creator of cold odes
Weaving nonsense in a boring way
Calls the general to dinner
O Galich faithful friend of the glass
And fat morning feasts
I call you lazy sage
To the shelter of poetry happy
Under the distant shelter of bliss
For a long time in my solitude
In a circle of bottles and friends
We haven't ripened a mug of yours
Friends of long pleasures
The guests' wit and laughter
You have no desire to work
Get on the troika of evil horses
Leave Petropolis and your worries behind
Fly to the happy town
Go to the Jew Zolotarev
In his common corner for everyone
We gathered there in a circle
Let's pour out a crimson stream of wine
And with a bang the doors are locked
Ban on youthful fun
And a proud pie on the table
Friends in cramped rows
Flashing with bright knives
With you we will bravely lay siege
And in a moment we will destroy the walls
When weighed down with wine
With head bowed on knees
If you want to rest in peace
And sinking into the pillow
To sleep more peacefully
You'll drop a filled mug
On an old velvet sofa
Then the messages are couplets
Ballads fables sonnets
They will leave our modest pocket
And the sloth's sleep will be deep
But the clink of glasses will wake you up
You will jump up with a cheerful head
You'll leave a crumpled pillow
Raise your sweet friend
And in the cell there is a feast again
O Galich time is irrevocable
And the terrible hour is near near
When I heard the voice of glory
I will leave the pleasant shelter of the cell
I'll throw off my robe for Tatar
Forgive me virgin Muses
Forgive the shelter of young joys
I'll put on tight leggings
I'll curl my proud moustache into rings
A pair of epaulettes will sparkle
And I am the pet of important Muses
Among the warring cornets
Oh Galich Galich hurry up
They call you and sleep is lazy
And a friend who is neither modest nor arrogant
And the cup is full to the brim
The moon is creeping across the sky
On the hill the darkness turns grey
Silence fell upon the waters
The wind blows from the valley
The singer of spring days is silent
In the desert of the dark grove
The herds rested in the middle of the fields
And the quiet flight of fullness
And a peaceful corner of bliss
The night has clothed me in darkness
The fire in the fireplace goes out
And the candle burned out
The faces of the household gods are worth it
In a poor ark
And the pale night light glows
Before the Clay Penate
Head bowed on hand
In deep oblivion
I am immersed in sweet thoughts
On a lonely bed
From the magical night to the darkness
In the moonlight
They fly off in a frisky crowd
Winged dreams
And the voice flows quietly quietly
The golden strings tremble
In the deep silent hour of darkness
The young dreamer sings
Filled with a secret longing
Inspired by silence
Flies with a nimble hand
On the lively lyre
Blessed is he who lives in his low hut
He does not ask for happiness in prayers
Zeus is his reliable guardian
From the terrible storm
On the poppies of laziness in a quiet hour
He falls asleep sweetly
And the terrible voice of war trumpets
It doesn't wake him up
Let him hit the resounding shield
And with a bold look
Glory threatens me from afar
With a bloody finger
And the battle banners are waving
And the bloody battle rages
Silence is lovely to the heart
I don't go for Slava
I found a peaceful shelter in the wilderness
And I lead my days humbly
The lyre was given to me by the gods
A priceless gift to a poet
And the faithful Muse is with me
Praise be to you goddess
My house is beautiful because of you
And the wild desert
On the weak morning of golden days
You have inspired the singer
A wreath of young myrtles
His forehead was covered
And illuminated by the heavenly light
She flew into the modest cell
And she barely breathed bowing down
Above the baby's cradle
Oh be my young companion
To the very gates of the grave
Fly with dreams above me
Spreading light wings
Drive away the gloomy sadness
Captivate the mind with deception
And the bright distance of a sweet life
Tell me behind the fog
And my late hour will be quiet
And the good genius of death
He whispers at the door while knocking
It's time to go to the shadow dwelling
So on a winter evening sweet dreams
Comes into the peaceful canopy
Crowned with poppy and inclined
On the staff of languid laziness
I want to die tomorrow
And into the magical world of pleasure
On the quiet shore of the waters of oblivion
Fly away like a cheerful shadow
Forgive forever the charm
The joy of life and love
Come closer my friends
Reverence and attention
The singer decided to die
So with the evening moon
Is it possible to put turf in the garden
With a patterned white veil
To the dark shore of sleepy waters
Where we had our conversations
Isn't it possible to arrange a long passage
Carrying filled cups
Call to the last feast
The arrogant son of Semele
Eros of our lyre's friend
Lord of gods and mortals
Let the fun come running
Waving a frisky rattle
And it will make us laugh from the heart
Over a full foamy mug
Let it be a playful crowd
Our native muses will fly away
They have the first round cup
Friends are sacred to us their bonds
Until the early morning star
Until the quiet rays of dawn
Will not leave the poet's hand
Vials of the fraternal series
I'll wash my pipe for the last time
Singer of sweet dreams
I will press you to my delighted chest
For the last time tenderly languished
I won't remember eternity and friends
For the last time on the snowy chest
I will drink in the joy of my youthful days
When will the East become golden
In the darkness the young morning star
And the white poplar will light up
Covered with morning dew
Give me some grapes of Anacreon
He was my teacher
And I will go one way
To the sad shore of Acheron
Sorry dear friends
Shake your hand goodbye
And give me a promise
When will I hide forever
My will to be fulfilled
Come my dear singer
The one who sang of Bacchus and Temira
I give you laziness and a lyre
May the Muses be above you
You will not forget our friendship
O Pushchin the windy sage
Accept with my deep cup
Withered Myrtle Crown
Friends I leave you my heart
And the memory of past red days
Bound by happy laziness
On a bed of poppies and lilies
I give my poems to oblivion
Last breath for her friends
On a quiet funeral feast
I have to invite you
Cheerfulness is the friend of solitude
Tickets will be distributed
Flock in a playful crowd
Heads in wreaths hand in hand
And let the singer be on the coffin
Will disappear in the groves of Helicon
Your fluent cutter will write
Here the Sage Youth slumbers
Pet of Neg and Apollo
Elvina my dear friend come and give me your hand
I'm withering stop the heavy dream of life
Tell me will I see you for a long separation
I am doomed by fate
Will a friend never look at a friend
Or are my days covered in eternal darkness
Will the morning never find us
In the arms of love
Elvina why in the deep hours of the night
I can't hug you with joy
Eyes full of yearning strive for the beloved
And tremble with passion
And in silent joy in the raptures of pleasure
Listen to your sweet whisper and quiet moan
And quietly in the modest darkness for the bliss of awakening
Fall asleep near my beloved
You are not the heir of Clerona
Your laws are not for you
The owner of Pindus wrote
God hasn't sent you much
Your voice of body movement
The silent appeal of gazes
I admit it's not worth the praise
And noisy splashes of surprise
Cruel fate destined
You'll be a bad actress
But Chloe you are lovely
There's a crowd of laughter following you
They promise joy to lovers
So the crowns are before you
And the successes are undeniable
You lead the viewer as a captive
When you sing without tact
Standing motionless before us
You eat and often at the wrong time
And we with diligent hands
Everyone claps loudly and shouts
The whistles of satirists are silent
And everyone submits to the lovely one
When in my awkwardness
You will fold your hands over your chest
Or you'll pick them up again
You will put it on your chest embarrassed
When Milon was young
Babbling something that is not for us
You assure yourself of love without feeling
Or in tears without memory
Cold emitting ah
You fall calmly into the chairs
Blushing and barely breathing
Everyone whispers oh how beautiful
Alas another one would have been booed
Beauty is a great thing
About Kloya the wise men lied
Not everything in the world is vanity
Captivate Chloe with your beauty
A hundred times blessed is that lover
Who is tender before you
Daring to sing about love
In verse and prose on stage
He swears to adore you
Who can you reply to
Not daring to speak of betrayal
Blessed is he who can forget his role
On stage with a cute actress
Shake her hand hoping to be
Even more blessed behind the scenes
Do you remember my brother from the cup
As in a pleasant silence
We drowned our sorrows
In pure sparkling wine
How silently hidden
In our dark corner
With Bacchus they luxuriated lazily
School guards in the distance
Do you remember the whispers of friends
Around the punch glasses
The menacing silence of glasses
Flame of penny pipes
Boiling over how wonderful
Currents of smoke flowed
Suddenly the pedant's terrible voice
We heard it in the distance
And the bottles are broken in an instant
And all the glasses are out the window
There are spills all over the floor
Punch and light wine
We run away in a hurry
The momentary fear disappeared in an instant
The color of rosy cheeks is playful
Mind and heart on the lips
Laughter of pure joy
A motionless dull gaze
Changed the hour of hangover
Sweet Bacchus' Conspiracy
Oh my dear friends
I swear to you at the table
Every year in carefree hours
Remember him with wine
Where are you my sloth
Lover of pleasure
Is it really solitude
You don't like peace
Am I really with you
With just paper
Minutes to spend
And no longer visible
The Parnassian Vagabond
My neighbor is on Pinda
And you hid from the Muses
Minute Homebody
Said goodbye to the penates
Already a dark corner
And the garden became empty
Where are we in the evening
They were making noise over drinks
Where Kom treated us
Trout pies
And a foamy glass
Bacchus served us
Days run after days
No friendly gatherings
Have a merry feast
Merry sons
Separated from you
And noisy conversations
And long lunches
Not so lively
Alone in a cramped closet
In the evening silence
I want a kind sage
Chat with you
The dark night already embraces
Shores of calm waters
Purring in the cell dozes
Arrogant old cat
For now the dream is lovely
Under the canopy of quiet wings
In the unknown abode
Didn't put me to sleep
Morpheus in anticipation
I'm lying in bed
And a quick message
Without strict diligence
I write to the traitor
Far from that village
Where are Phoebe's sisters
They weave my leisure with bliss
Tell me in the middle of the capital
What are you doing my friend
Is this really a poet's haven
Now in the midst of the whirlwind of light
Far from native fields
Both close and friends
Is it really in a noisy theatre
Where is the mighty Apollo
Half-witted partner
Glorified stunned
Exhausted by the chant
Meaningless poems
You sleep under a terrible roar
Actors and bows
Or a court sage
With a feigned smile
In front of the colored ribbon
With his head down
With a blind spinner
Would you like to meet someone
Il Cresa at the table
In the ordered verse
You are cowardly glorifying
No my good Galich
You are not akin to bowing
Friend of direct wisdom
Truthful and noble
He loves silence
Obedient to his fate
To the master's treasury
Looks on with indifference
Tax farmer's rubles
Laughing at a merry hour
Won't take off the cap
Philosopher before Midas
Let him not be friendly
With treacherous Fortune
But Bacchus was awarded
The grateful philosopher
When this god is young
In the evening time
Lafite and amber grog
With a smile on your lips
He brings it to him in glass
And asks for a drop to drink
Rocking on my feet
Embracing Dreaming
Love guides him
And young friendship
Weaves wreaths for him
And he is happy to admit
In reality not in dreams
When the minutes fly by
Fun on the wings
When friends are poets
From morning till night with him
They make noise and sing couplets
They drink warm Mosel
To my friends
The messages are read
And they light the pipe
Rhymeless and dashing
Leave the boring city
Get together with friends
And inseparable from them
Get along in the desert
Run run capital
Oh my Galich come here!
Here is the pink morning star
Never having seen
Lazing under the blanket
With the Sage of Tibur
We often have a glass
Let's wake up and fall asleep
Look at your reward
Our Delvig is our poet
Carries his ballad
And stanzas to the grapes
And a couplet to the lily
And it becomes full
Your small cramped house
Here with a cute wit
Our singer is dragging himself along
Down the stairs with a hoot
And we'll all come to you
And again every day
We will become prose in verse
We drive away the shadow of sorrow
Young girlfriends
We will be visited
Our lives are golden days
It's not scary to waste
Let's share the fun
We are the rest of the century
With the sorceress glory
And with young Bacchus
The last radiance behind the forest of grief
The evening dawn quietly faded
The silent valley is deaf
A river swirls in the desert fog
The clouds move in a lazy row
Between them is the golden moon
Cast iron armor lies on the hill
The spear is shattered in the glove of damask steel
And a shield under a rusty helmet
The spurs dug into the damp moss
They lie motionless and the moon's horn
Above them in a bloody blaze
A friend of the strong horse circles around the hill
The fire in the proud eyes has faded
He bows his warlike head
With a carefree hoof he beats the stone of the valleys
And one faithful horse looks at the armor
And it trembles and groans wildly
In the darkness lost the alien walks
With hope he carries timidity in his heart
Bending over a walking stick
He climbed the hill and into the dim distance
He looks and goes down and rings the steel
Pushes with a tired leg
The alien grows cold the chain mail sounds
The bones of the deceased are knocking menacingly in them
He rolled like a helmet over the stones
The skull was hidden in it with a dull sound
The horse neighed galloping briskly up the hill in the summer
He looked and bowed his head
Already the traveler wanders far away in the darkness of the night
It seems like bones are crunching under my feet
But the morning star brings forth
Slain in battle lies on the hill
And the armor is motionless and the helmet does not knock
And the horse walks around the dead man
Listen to the innocent muses
The Cunning Confessor
Dweller in the desert fields
The sinful face of poets
I have multiplied by myself
And my head sank
Before a sweet dream
My Uncle the Poet
That's what he gave me advice for
And he made a match with the muses
At first I was naughty
I wrote poems in jest
And there he printed them
And now I'm a brother
To the empty fool
To this and that
Well it's my fault
Thank you for the message
But what good does that do me
On the sinner later
For they will become a laughing stock
Pointing with the finger
Traitor with Apollo
You are obviously at the same time
And I will be known as Pradon
From now on it is destined
I'll find troubles everywhere
Alas I am a metromaniac
Where will I hide
Traitors-friends
Innocent creation
They send it to the city secretly
And the fruit of solitude
Embossing is given over to
Paper is being killed
The poet is surrounded
With a smile of wit
Ah sir I was told
You write poems
Is it possible to see them
You portrayed them
Of course streams
Of course cornflower
Or a quiet breeze
And groves and flowers
About Delvig they wrote
The Muses are my destiny
But are you my sorrows
I wanted to multiply
In the arms of Morpheus
Cherishing a carefree spirit
Just one more year
Let me be lazy
And enjoy the bliss
I am the son of bliss
At least there is no hunting there
But worries will come
From all sides towards me
And I will be forced
Fight with magazines
Bargain with the newspaper
To admire with Grafov
Have mercy Apollo
Where is our rose
My friends
The rose has withered
Child of the Dawn
Don't say
This is the youth of life
Don't repeat it
This is how joy fades
Tell me in your soul
I'm sorry I regret it
And on the lily
Show us
The fighting between tribes in the distant lands has died down
The noise of battle and the voice of military trumpets are not heard
From the heavenly heights to the sound of slender lyres
A bright world descends upon the dark earth
It has happened Russian Tsar you have achieved your glorious goal
In vain did the arrogant fly to their homeland
In vain in front of the banners of countless troops
The giant crowned in mighty audacity
He walked menacingly to his death dragging chains behind him
A fiery sword flashed behind smoky Moscow
The star of the destroyer has faded into eternal darkness
And the fiery crown faded on his forehead
The son of happiness and the one abandoned by fate shuddered
He did not see the Russian land beneath him
He runs and the thunder of vengeance flies after him
And the proud one fell from the throne and rose again and no more
To you our brave king praise and thanksgiving
When the enemy regiments covered the distance
Having put on a feathered helmet in his armor
Kneeling before the highest altar
You drew your sword of war and swore a holy oath
To protect my native country from the yoke
We heeded this oath and our proud hearts
In ardent delight they flew after their father
And they burned and trembled with fatal death
And the Russians became a formidable stronghold before the enemy
A cry was heard from the swords and they rushed like a whirlwind
The banners rustled and fluttered in the wind
Brother hugged his brother and gave his hand to his dear
Young warriors on a sad separation
They fought the fierce battle of freedom flared up
And death grabbed them with a cold hand
And I am in the distance of thunder in your reliable shade
I blossomed quietly carefree serene
Alas the mysterious limit did not judge me
Fight for you under a hail of enemy arrows
Sons of Borodin o Kulm heroes
I saw how your formations flew to battle
With an enthusiastic soul he hurried after his brothers
Why didn't I shed blood for the battlefield
Why do you clutch the sword with your baby hand
Covered with wounds I did not fall before you
And glory did not rest under his wing in the morning
Why haven't you witnessed great deeds
Oh how majestic immortal you have appeared
When he rushed at the strong man with his sons
And raising their foreheads from the darkness of the coffins
Peoples fallen under the burden of shackles
They shook the heavy chain with delight
And with timid joy they asked each other
Are we really free Has the terrible one fallen
Who is brave Who rose up in the thunders of the north
And Europe bowed its ancient head
The tribes surrounded the king-savior
With a hand freed from slave bonds
And the rebellious power disappeared before you
And now you have returned to your sons our king
And the edge of midnight was illuminated with delight
Turn your gaze upon your people with full humility
All faces shine with joy and love
Listen the good news is spreading everywhere
Everywhere a proud cry of joy is heard
There is noise in the streets celebration shines everywhere
And you are a deity among the crowd of Russia
Your squads fly to meet the leader of victories
The old man happily forgot Catherine for a century
Looks at you with silent tears
You our Russian Tsar leave your steel helmet
And the formidable sword of war and shield of our fence
Pour out the sacred cup of peace before Janus
And crushing the battles with a mighty hand
The universe of autumn with the desired silence
And golden times of peace will come
Rust will cover helmets and hardened arrows
In quivers the hidden ones will forget their flight
A happy peasant not knowing violent troubles
The world's most sophisticated plow will be pulled through the fields
The flying ships are lit up by trade
The free ocean will be cut through with sterns
And the young sons of the warlike Slavs
They will indulge in quiet idleness with annoyance
And silently they will gather around the elder one day
They will bow their greedy ears and the old crutch
And the camp and the military formation and the distant pine forest with the hill
On the dust he will slowly draw before them
With free and simple words of truth
He will revive the glory of past years in stories for them
And he will bless the good king in tears
So I was happy and so I enjoyed myself
I was intoxicated with quiet delight and joy
And where is the quick day of fun
The summer of dreams flew by
The charm of pleasure has faded
And again around me there is a shadow of gloomy boredom
Yesterday over a bowl of punch
I sat with the hussar
And silently with a gloomy soul
I looked at the distant path
Say you're looking at the road
My brave questioner
Thank God for that too
I didn't see my friends off
With his head bowed to his chest
I soon whispered
Hussar she is no longer with me
He sighed and fell silent
A tear hung on the eyelash
And sank into the glass
Child you are crying for a girl
Shame on you he shouted
Leave the hussar oh my heart hurts
You didn't know that you were grieving
Alas one tear is enough
To poison the glass
There are three sullen singers
Shikhmatov Shakhovskoy Shishkov
The mind has three enemies
Shishkov our Shakhovskoy Shikhmatov
But who is the stupidest of the three evil ones
Shishkov Shikhmatov Shakhovsky
You are eight years old and I was seventeen
And I once counted eight years
They passed through their sad fate
God knows how I became a poet today
There is no way to return what was
I'm already old and I don't know lies
So believe me we are saved by faith alone
Listen Cupid how good you are
Cupid child Cupid looks like you
In my years you will be Venus
But if only I'm alive
By the supreme goodness of Zeus
And just as eloquent
I will write to you Baroness
In the Latin flavor of madrigal
Wonderful without art at all
Not much true praise
But there is a lot of true feeling
I will say for the sake of your eyes
O Baroness for the sake of balls
When we all look at you
Look at me for once
As a reward for the previous madrigals
When will Cupid and Hymen
In my lovely Mary
Congratulate the young lady
Will I be able to do it in my old age
I dedicate an epithalamium to you
Have mercy sober Aristarchus
My Bajic messages
Don't judge my dreams
And feelings in windy verses
The fruits of fun leisure
Not born for immortality
But are they really that well-preserved
For myself for a friend
Or for young Chloe
Have mercy have pity on me
I don't need your lessons
I know my own vices
Of course my genius is poor
Behind the rhyme there is often a bachelor
In defiance of the laws of combination
The trestoppers are running in a crowd
On ayu there is aet and on oi
A few more confessions
I bet who is without sin
Empty exclamations often
And three extra verses in a row
Not good but excuses
Could you please modestly bring
My flying messages
Will the offspring bloom
Don't think my censor is gloomy
That I go crazy at night
Bound by poetic thought
I sacrifice peace to poetry
That running around all corners
I ruffle my hair in clumps
Like the priests of Phoebus
I flash my menacing eyes
Barely breathing frowning
And having lit his lamp
I'll sit down at the shaky table groaning
I've been sitting and sitting for three nights in a row
And I'll sit through this trashy nonsense
He writes so not to reproach
Equerry of the Decrepit Pegasus
Whistles of Whips or Counts
Retired Minister of Parnassus
Parent of old poems
And one that is not too loud
And the fairy tales are rather boring
I love idleness and peace
And leisure is not a burden for me at all
I will find time to eat and drink
When at some unexpected time
The desire to scribble poetry will find
For the glory of Friendship or Eros
I will finish my work immediately
Am I sitting with good friends
Am I lying in a downy bed
I wander over the quiet waters
In the dark and dense oak grove
I'll think about it and wave my hands
I'll suddenly start speaking in rhymes
And I don't kill anyone anymore
With my lively poems
But if ever
Wanting to rest in bliss
Sitting in front of the fireplace
One free master
I will catch my previous thought
It is not for the poet's name
I'll write two or three verses
And I sing them in a low voice
But do you know about my persecutor
How I talk to you
Carefree Pinda visitor
I am basking with the Muse young
The morning is already shining brightly
The fields and groves were illuminated
The roosters have crowed for a long time
Half-eyed dozing and yawning
Chapelle calling in songs
I write short poems
Among the pleasant oblivion
Leaning my head into the pillow
And in simplicity without decoration
My apologies
With a slightly sleepy hand
Under the shadow of unknown laziness
So the lovely singer basked
When Ver-Vera sang
Or he drew with a smile
In a relaxed rapture
Secluded attic of your own
In such a lazy position
The poems flow this way and that
Is it possible in your creation
Having calmed down the noise of cheerful thoughts
Then put your cold mind to work
To spoil fables with decoration
The fruits of wandering frisky thoughts
And shorten your pages
Anacreon Chaulieu Boys
Enemies of labor worries sorrows
It wasn't like that in the old days
They sang praises to their mistresses
O you dear singers
Sons of lazy carelessness
The crowns have long been given to you
From the muse of happy idleness
But not shiny gifts
Poetry of the hardworking
On the top of Mount Thessaloniki
Secret twists and turns led you
The playful finger of the Merry Graces
He revived the young lyres
And your foreheads were wrapped around
The children of Paphos are a playful swarm
And I am an inexperienced poet
The careless heir of your rhymes
I'm sneaking after you
And you are my boring preacher
Moderate the learned taste of anger
Go and shout abuse at someone else
And throw away the young sloth
Quietly regretting it
In paradise beyond sad Acheron
Yawning in a dense grove
The Creator beloved by Alollon
I decided to see the earthly world
He was a famous writer
A famous Russian merry fellow
The mocker wrapped in laurels
Denis is a scourge and fear for the ignorant
Let me step away for a while
He said to the Lord of Hell
I am sick of gloomy Phlegethon
And I want to appear to people
Go answer him Pluto
And he sees before him
In a boat with a flickering crowd
The wrinkled Charon rows
Shuttle to the shore with travel documents
The hero sailed in an empty boat
And here it comes to us into the light
Welcome poet
A dead man appeared in Russia
He is looking for some news
But the light didn't change at all
Everything goes in the same order
People are still hypocritical
They still sing the same songs
Slanderers are still believed
Things are going as usual
Millions are jumping out the windows
Everyone is stealing the treasury from the king
Some people live while others cry
And the doctors torture mortals
Bishops sleep peacefully
The nobles are notable villains
Laughing as they pour wine into glasses
The complaints of the innocent are not heeded
They play at night in the senate dozing
Leaning on the red cloth
Still so many cowards and impudent people
Rubles are the same as Cypriots
And so many stupid generals
And so much old red tape
Denis sighed Oh my god
Again I see the same thing
The formidable Demosthenes in front
You are right my speaker Petrushka
The whole world is a useless toy
And there is no change in the toy
But where are the fellow poets
My Parnassian minions
Pets of the Graces of the Young
I would really like to see them
Leaving the bright canopy of heaven
With a winged cap on the back
Gods young messenger
Suddenly an arrow flies towards him
Let's go said Hermias to the poet
I am your guide here
Phoebus himself asked me about it
We'll make it before dawn
Russian singers to visit
Reward others with vines
Others entwine their flutes with a wreath
He said they took off and flew away
The clear day has already disappeared
The dark shadow was already thickening
Evening was already turning towards night
Moonlight flickered through the windows
And everyone who is not a poet
I indulged in sweet morpheme
Hermione with the Merry Dead Man
They flew into the attic of a tall building
There Kropov is in deep silence
With paper a bottle and a pen
Sat at the table deep in thought
On a shabby tripod chair
And with a swollen public syllable
For our mortal sins
Forged both prose and poetry
Who is he Publisher of Democritus
Publisher of the law is ridiculous
He is not a poet who craves laurels
If only I was drunk sometimes
It's hard to read his poems
And prose is oh so bitter for everyone
But why laugh at the poor thing
By God brother it's a terrible sin
Wouldn't it be better to leave the attic
And then direct the flight
To the Russian singers
Let's fly to Mercury
And both travelers set off
And in two minutes they sank down
Khvostov straight to the office
He did not sleep our good poet
I strung together an ode for the occasion
How God's martyr groaned
The draftsman crossed out sweat
To become a laughing stock to the people
There is a pen in his teeth
On the Annenskaya tape tobacco
There is ink spilled everywhere
Khvostov snores sadly to himself
Who's rolling towards me at midnight
Am I delirious in my sleep
What happened to the poor head
Von Vizin are you in front of me
Have mercy of course he is
I definitely want me to be Pluto
From the dark shadows of the dwelling
With an honorary member of the infernal forces
I let him go here for a while
Khvostov my old friend
Tell me how you spend time
Are you healthy or are you living happily
Alas for the unfortunate poet
Khvostov answered with a frown
I haven't had any luck in anything for a long time
I'll tell you without further ado
For me it's like Parnassian enthusiasm
I wish I could hang myself at that very moment
I swear that I am good at that
I write and sing in every way
My genius was praised in the newspapers
In Aspasia they idolize
And I am still the last among poets
I am scolded by both young and old
They don't want to read my poems
Wherever I go there is a whistle
My enemy is the last journalist
The boys are laughing at me
There is only one Anastasevich
My faithful godson reader and son
He assures with his prose
What will crown my idol
Progeny with a laurel wreath
Nobody thinks about it
But I will put my own spin on it
Let my hairdresser again
Poor Khvostov's hair will curl
His poem was commissioned
The rest of the hair is already grey
Arming ourselves with heroic courage
And I will end my life over paper
And I will write in hell forever
And read parables to the devils
Denis shrugged his shoulders
The courier of the gods laughed
And flapping its wings over the candle
Disappeared in the darkness with Fon-Vizin
Khvostov was not too surprised
Calmly lit a candle
He sighed yawned and crossed himself
He set out to finish his work
In the morning I made an ode
And he put the city to sleep with it
Meanwhile he bowed to Khvostov
The creator who copied Prostakova
Three nights in dark attics
In big and small cities
Scarecrow of Russian poets
In his bosquet Prince Crazy
The Beauty of Morpheus Writers
I was sitting with a notebook
Drawing flowers and bushes in it
And moving the leaves with sighs
I wet them with tender tears
When is the ghost so wonderful
Appeared before the eyes of the lover
Grabbing hold of the dress the kind one
Oh he fainted in fear
And you Slavic-Russian are inflated
O the notorious Bezvergolnik
And you almost turned pale
As if from Shishkov's gaze
Petriada fell from my hands
And the wild gaze became numb
And you were fed by priests
Trained in the psalter by a deacon
A terrible old man for critics
You saw the shadows' menacing face
Your innocent friend
The already faded color of the singers
Vralikh Goddess of Petropolis
She fell prostrate before him in fear
And the monthly sigher
Which shamelessly publishes to the world
Coquettes of the old cabinet
An illiterate schoolboy writer
Was visited by a stern shadow
Cupid didn't save the child
The zealous guardian of the honor of the muses
He scolded him mercilessly
And he tore out the poor man's ears
Von-Visin's hand is scary
I don't have enough desire to hunt
He said to the thin scribes
Just wasting time yawning
I'm ready to die again
But where is Catherine's singer
On the banks of the Neva he sings
So the Stygian valleys
He hasn't seen it yet alas
Alas tell me what does this mean
Denis midnight laurel has faded
Spring has passed summer has passed too
The poet's fire has cooled
You will see everything for yourself
Let's fly to the singer under the gray hair
Listen to the old man for an hour
They fly in three blinks
Among the decorated room
Saw the singer Felitsa
The venerable elder recognized them
Von Vizin immediately told
My adventures in that world
So you're here as a ghost
Derzhavin said he was very happy
Accept my blessings
Scat cat sit down deceased brother
What a calm weather
But by the way here is an ode to glory
Listen brother and old man
Coughing and scratching my wig
He started singing his creation
Biblical articles suggestion
That was a direct hymn from the hymns
A couple of disembodied people in amazement
She listened silently to the singing
With his head down
The door of sacred secrets has opened
Lucifer comes from the abyss
Humble but brow-beating
Napoleon Napoleon
Paris and the New Babylon
And the meek white-fleeced lamb
Surpassing like the divine Gog
Fell like the spirit of Sataniel
The demonic power has disappeared
Blessed be our Lord God
Oh my mocker exclaimed
What's better than such poems
I wouldn't have been able to get any sense out of them myself
The late Mr Bobrov
What happened to you Derzhavin
And you are equal in fate to Newton
You are God you are a worm you are light you are night
Let's go Mercury my heart hurts
Let's go I'm involuntarily furious
And in an instant he flew away
What a wonderful phenomenon
Von Vizin told his companion
Leave empty surprise
Ermiy answered with a grin
On Pindus the glorious Lomonosov
I once saw with annoyance
What a sonorous lyre in the host of the Russians
The shaved Tatar thundered
And with the wrath of Pindar Kholmogor
And he burned with secret envy
But Phoebus heard the voice of reproach
I wanted to calm him down
And my Derzhavin stumbled
Apocalypse to be translated
Denis he will be famous forever
But ah why live so long
It's time to go home Ermia said
A terrible dead man for rhymers
Let's leave Russia for now
I'm finally tired of wandering
But suddenly near the knocking mill
In the middle of a dense gloomy grove
On the bank of the noisy river
The hut is simple
The road to the gate is narrow
An ancient maple tree leaned out the window
And Falconetov Cupid
Threatens with a grin at the threshold
Of course the singer lives here
The dead man said happily
Let's go up We went up and what did we see
In pleasant bliss on the bed
Singer Penatov young
With a head crowned with roses
Barely covered with a blanket
I dozed with the lovely Lila
And browned with a violet
In sweet oblivion he whispered
Von Vizin looks amazed
Familiar appearance but who is he
Isn't it the incomparable Guys
Or Kleist or Anacreon himself
He's worth it Mercury said
Erata of Grace Cupid
They crowned him with myrtles
And Phoebus with the golden horse
Honored his favorite
But laziness is tied by the bridle
He only drinks laughs and sleeps
And he basks in youth with Lila
Having completely forgotten that he is a singer
Well I'll wake up the rake
Fon-Vizin said getting angry
And in an instant he pulled back the curtain
The singer heard the prophetic voice
I woke up covered in fluff with annoyance
He stretched out his hands lazily
I barely looked into the light
Then he turned to the side
And again he fell into a deep sleep
What should our hero do
Hang your nose and go to rest
And only grumble to myself
I heard it as if out of annoyance
He scolded the Russians without mercy
And here is what he deigned to say
When Khvostov starts working
And Batyushkov sleeps peacefully
Our genius will not rise again for a long time
And things won't go well
All in mysterious silence
The hill was dressed in darkness
Walks in the cloudy glow
Young crescent moon
Dark myrtle curtain
Leaned towards the waters
In their shade at the entrance to the forest
Whose tomb do I see there
Young roses turn red
Ancient stone all around
And the Zephyrs don't dare them
Shine with a trembling wing
I see a lyre over a grave
Dozing in sweet silence
Only sometimes a sad ringing
As if the voice of laziness is sweet
In the dead one a string is heard
I see a turtle dove on the lyre
In roses cup and crown
Each other in eternal peace
Here the sage of Teos sleeps
Look at the tomb
The son of joy is depicted
Here on the windy fork
Our frisky Anacreon
Enchanted by beauty
He tenderly sings hymns to her
Crowned with grapes
His juice pours into the cup
Here he is looking in the mirror
Saying I'm gray and old
Let me enjoy life
Life alas is not an eternal gift
Here I throw my hand on the lyre
And frowning importantly
He wants to sing of the god of war
But he sings of one love
Here nature is preparing
He has a heavy debt to pay
The old man dances in a round dance
Asks to quench his thirst
Around the gray-haired philosopher
The maidens dance and sing
He is in a stingy time
Steals a few minutes
Here are the Muses and the Charites
The favorite was taken away to the coffin
Covered with ivy roses
The games and laughter followed suit
He disappeared like a delight
Like an indistinct sigh of love
Your mortal age is a dream
Catch the fast happiness
Enjoy enjoy
Fill the cup more often
Be tired of tender passion
And rest over the cup
Do you want to know my dear friend
My dreams desires goals
And the quiet voice of a simple flute
Listen with a friendly smile
But can a poet be playful
To the slave of a young dream
The picture is fast and lively
To depict in order of light
All that in golden youth
My imagination tells me
Now that I'm at peace I'm lazy
Covering me in the deserted shadow
With its chain of feelings it binds
And my age is as quiet as a clear day
Decorations of empty bliss
Not seeing in my hut
I look with a smile of regret
On the splendor of the poor rich
And happy with myself
I don't crave a mountain of silver
I don't know tomorrow or yesterday
Satisfied with the modest Fate
And I think what is the point for singers
Diamonds hyacinths topazes
Porphyry empty vases
Precious dolls in the corners
What do they need the cloth of Albion for
And the lush covers of Lyon
On fashionable chairs and tables
And a shawl bed in the bedroom
Wouldn't it be better in a distant village
Or in a humble town
Far from the capitals of worries and thunder
Take refuge in a peaceful corner
With which luxury is unfamiliar
Where can you relax on holidays
Oh if only someday
The poet's dreams came true
Is there really a joy in solitude
He is not destined to taste
I see my village
It's my Zakharovo
With fences in the wavy river
With a bridge and a shady grove
Reflected by a mirror of waters
My house on the hill from the balcony
I can go to the cheerful garden
Where Flora and Pomona are together
They give me flowers and fruits
Where the old maples are in a dark row
Ascends to the sky
And the poplars rustle dully
I hurry there at dawn
With a humble spade in hand
I wind my path through the meadows
I water the tulip and the rose
And happy in the morning labors
Here under the leaning oak tree
With Horace and La Fontaine
Lost in pleasant dreams
Nearby a stream is noisy and jumping
And rushes along the wet banks
And the light current hides with annoyance
In the neighboring groves and meadows
But now it’s noon in the bright hall
The round table is set with fun
Bread and salt on a clean blanket
The cabbage soup and wine are steaming in a glass
And the pike lies in the tablecloth
Neighbors in a noisy crowd
They came up and broke the silence
We sit down and listen to the ringing of the cups
Everyone praises Bacchus and Pomona
And with them the red spring
Here is a secluded office
Where I am tired of Moscow
Far from deceptive beauty
Away from frowning worries
And that cunning sorceress
Which makes the whole world go round
The trumpet never stops blaring
And I remember it was called Slava
I live with natural simplicity
With philosophical fun
And with a frisky and young muse
Here is my fireplace in the dark evening
In the stormy autumn time
I love under the secluded canopy
To dream thoughtfully before him
Voltaire Wieland read
Or in a moment of inspiration
Carelessly scribble stanzas
And then burn your creations
Here but quickly ghosts
Born in a magic lantern
Flashing on the white canvas
Dreams are found and disappear
Like a shadow at dawn
Meanwhile in the silent cell
I surrendered myself to dreams
With a careless and lazy hand
Scattering rhymes here and there
I hear the stomping I hear the neighing
Flashing a patterned saddle cloth
In the brilliant ment of radiance
A hussar rushed past the window
And where are you peaceful pictures
Charming rural simplicity
Among the warlike valley
I am carried on the wings of my dreams
The fires in the camp are burning out
Among them wrapped in a cloak
With a gray-haired mustachioed Cossack
I lie in the distance bayonets are sparkling
The daring ones laugh and bite the reins
Yes occasionally thunder rumbles
Flying from a high peak
My chest trembles with battle
In the gleam of battle-stained damask steel
My gaze burns with fire and I
I'm flying to the death of the enemy
My horse is an eagle in the ranks of enemies
Rushing with a formidable rider
Blows rain down with force
O you fatherly Lares
Save the young man in battles
There he whistles with his jagged saber
There the feathered shako sways
With a Circassian burka on his shoulders
And silently bowing to the mane
He rushes like an arrow across the slippery field
With a smoky cigar in his teeth
But they are wreathed in the laurels of victory
The fighters drink from the cup of peace
Forgotten by military glory
I hasten to my humble shelter
Found on the field of battle and honor
Some diseases are crutches
He left the sword of vengeance forever
I can already see in the gloomy distance
My cramped house the groves are dark
Gate garden near pond
And again I am a humble philosopher
I took refuge in my dear shelter
And the world forgotten and forgotten by them
I taste peace of soul again
Tell me about your heart priceless friend
Is it a dream and friendship and love
Until now in carefree playfulness
My days wandered through roses
In the innocent clarity of the heart
I have never known the torments of love
But quickly day after day rushed away
Where are the early traces of childhood
The lovely age has passed
The first flowers have faded
My heart no longer beats with joy
At the cute sight of a butterfly
What is swirling and whirling in the air
With the quiet breath of the breeze
And in incomprehensible anxiety
I'm burning smoldering blood is burning
And all in a language understandable to the heart
Speaks of tender passion
Golden age friend
Friend of the red childhood years
Do I see the light of your gaze
Friend of the heart dear Sushkova
Your image is with me everywhere
My dear ghost is with me everywhere
In the darkness of dreary midnight
In the hours of the golden dawn
Then at the end of the dark alley
In the quiet evening time
Alone in languid thoughtfulness
I see you before me
Your figure is not covered with a shawl
Your gaze is downcast on your chest
In the cheeks of love the bashful color
The moonlight still quietly glimmers
The frowning poplar moves
The gloom is already a dim veil
It falls on the distant hills
And the curtain of the grove flows
Above the quietly sleeping wave
Silvered by the moon
You are alone in the grove with me
Leaning on my crutches
You stand under a thick willow tree
And the wind of twilight frolicking
A cool breeze blows on my snowy chest
Plays with a lock of hair
And draws a slender leg
Through your snow-white cover
Then at the deep hour of midnight
In front of your high tower
In the gloomy winter time
I'm waiting for my dear beauty
The sleigh is ready the darkness is thick
Everyone is sleeping only I am sad
I call the clock's lazy chime
And a dull rustling sound seems to be heard
And now I hear a sweet whisper
The lovely one came down from the porch
Breathing barely he walks furtively
And the maiden embraced her friend
The horses raced off into the distance
The manes were loose in the wind
Rushing through the snowy depths
You timidly pressed yourself against me
Barely breathing we were stunned
In rapture the senses became numb
But the dreams have flown away
Alas I was happy in my dream
In the silence that pleases the muses
With the simple sounds of the flute
My friend I sang for you
The dream of young singers is destiny
Pet of Muses and Inspiration
Striving for Fantasy
Finds pleasure in the heart
And on the path of impending troubles
Golden minutes of happiness
Let Klofo not tell me
In dreams all earthly joys
The poet is more powerful than fate
Child of the Harites and imagination
In a fit of fiery soul
With a careless brush of pleasure
Write to me a friend of the heart
The beauty of heavenly innocence
The timid features of hope
The smile of a lovely soul
And the gaze of beauty itself
Around the thin frame of Gebei
Tie the Venus belt
The Hidden Charm of Alban
Surround my queen
Transparent waves of the blanket
Throw it over your quivering chest
So that she can breathe under it too
I wanted to secretly sigh
Imagine the dream of a shy love
And the one I breathe
By the hand of a happy lover
I'll sign my name below
Tomorrow with a penny candle
I will appear before the holy image
My friend stayed alive
But he was already under the scythe of death
Sazonov was my servant
And Peschel is my doctor
Eyes squinting at curly mustache
Hussar with a majestic smile
He wound curls around his finger
Sage with a shaved beard
Shaking his head quietly
The mustachioed man said with a sigh
The hussar is still perishable under the moon
Like waves following wave after wave
Kingdoms and centuries pass by
Tell me where the walls of Babylon are
Where are the skinny dramas of Cleon
The river has flown away forever
Your mustache is twisted behind your ears
Sprinkled with wine and rum
Proud of youthful beauty
Doesn't know the prescribed razor
He is always shining with antimony
Straightened with a comb and hand
So as not to crush the dashing mustache
You will sing Khvostov's ode by night
You'll wrap it up quietly
Don't dare to lie down with your nose in the pillow
And in deep sleep you cherish it
And in the morning you will curl it again
At long cheerful dinners
In the circle of gray-haired hussars
And the black-moustached daredevils
A cheerful guest is an ardent lover
For whose health are you breaking bottles
Horse of beauties and mustaches
The terrible hour of battle will come
The core will crash into the ranks with a crash
And you are above the dashing saddle
You don't waste your mind and memory
First you grab the curly mustache
And then the faithful saber
Bound by magical power
Alone with a sweet beauty
You're struggling with one hand
In the raptures of voluptuous bliss
You wander through the beautiful chest
And you twist another menacing mustache
Be proud hussar but remember forever
That everything in the world is fleeting
The destructive hours fly by
The blush on your cheeks will turn yellow
And the black curls will turn grey
And old age will pluck out the mustache
Blessed is he who is in the noise of the city
Dreams of solitude
Who sees only in the distance
Desert Garden Country House
Hills with silent forests
A valley with a frisky stream
And even a flock with a shepherd
Blessed is he who has good friends
Sits at the table until night
And over the Slavic fools
Laughs with Russian poems
Blessed is he who sees noisy Moscow
For the hut does not leave
And not in a dream but in reality
He caresses his mistress
Christ is risen pet of Phoebus
May God grant that by the grace of heaven
Reason has been resurrected in Rus'
He seems to have disappeared
God grant that in the whole universe
Peace and silence have been resurrected
So that in the venerable Academy
The limbs were resurrected from sleep
So that in our sinful times
The virtue of our ancestors has been resurrected
To spite the Shikhmatovs
A new Boileau has risen
Raskol is a witness to stupidity
And with him more silver
But let there be no Sunday
Deceased prose and poetry
May they not rise from oblivion
The late Mr Bobrov
Worthy of the newspaperman's praise
And Nikolev the late poet
And the restless Count Khvostov
And all that are in the world
They wrote too cleverly
That is it is both cold and dark
Which is very shameful and sinful
Enough of the battle rushed thunder
The bloody sword was dulled
And death with its fatal wing
It made a menacing noise over the universe
It was accomplished by the eyes of the kings
Europe's solid peace is founded
The villain who overthrew the shackles
Bound again by mighty abuse
He saw Moscow in flames
And the horror of the world was cast down
Covered the fallen head
Blessed Porphyry
And was surrounded by darkness
He came running and suddenly with violent betrayal
He was already erecting his shaky throne
And fell cut off from the universe
Everything has calmed down the thunder does not rush
A bloody sword does not shine
And the battle with the deadly wing
It does not rush menacingly over the universe
Praise be to the heroic youth
With the marvelous hero of Albion
He led the faithful into the last battle
And avenged the lilies of Bourbon
Before him the thunder of rebellion thundered
Bloody shields flowed in their wake
He flew like a thunderstorm in the darkness of battle
And poured out the radiance of glory
His blood was young
The ulcer of honor shines on him
Crown crown his love
He was a worthy warrior of revenge
Let the Poet with a hired censer
Chases happiness and rumors
I am afraid of the light my dark age is passing
In the obscurity of the path that has died out
Let the singers thunder with praises
Demigods are given immortality
My voice is quiet and sonorous strings
I will not fill the shelter with silence
Let Ovid sing love
Cytherea haunts me
Cupids don't weave happy days for me
I sing of sleep the priceless gift of Morpheus
And I will teach you how it should be in silence
Rest in a pleasant deep sleep
Come oh Laziness come to my desert
Coolness and peace call you
In you alone I see my goddess
Everything is ready for the young guest
All is quiet here the annoying noise has disappeared
Over my threshold to the bright window
The transparent canvas descended
And into the dark niche where the gloom reigned
The uncertain light of day steals in a little
Here is my sofa Come to the abode of peace
If I were your queen I am now your captive
Everything is yours here are the paints the brush and the Lyre
Teach me to move my hand
And you are friends of my lovely muse
By which the bonds of love are forgotten
Which are the dominion of the earth
Of course we preferred a peaceful sleep
O wise men we know how to marvel at you
For you alone I am now the throne of Morpheus
I will cover my shoes with flowers of poetry
For you alone I will sing bliss
Listen with a smile of condescension
My poems are lessons of pleasure
At the hour of bliss appointed by nature
Do you want to forget yourself every time
In the stillness of the night amidst the general silence
In the arms of playful dreams
Hurry under the peaceful roof of the countryside
You can live there idly and carefree
It's like paradise there but away from the cities
Where the cries and noise of sloths torment eternally
I agree I can wear them all day long
To catch the shadow of fun with a beauty
In a scarf yawning shining in a fashionable light
At the ball at night spinning on the dance floor
But can one taste the joy of dreams
The shadow has come only I am ready to fall asleep
Deceived by the ghosts of the night
And now by the light of the lanterns
On a mad team of four horses
Knocking and rattling with golden wheels
Arrogance rolls under my windows
I'm dozing again the street is shaking again
Absent-mindedness flies to a boring ball
Oh my god do they really sleep here
To be tormented by insomnia all night long
They're still knocking but it's already light there
And where is my sleep isn't it better in the village
There is a grove of leaves trembling
In the meadow the stream murmurs mysteriously
The silence of the valley of golden fields
In the village everything is inclined to languor and sleep
About sweet sleep not disturbed by anything
One rooster awakened by dawn
He might raise his sharp cry
He is dangerous he can wake up
So let them be in seraglios remote
The Sultans of Chickens Are Proud of the Prisoners
Or the villagers are called to the fields
We want to sleep dear friends
A hundred times blessed is he who can forget himself in sleep
Far away from the capitals of carriages and roosters
But with the sweetness of a merry night of dreams
Don't think you'll enjoy it for nothing
Among the peaceful ones I ate without any effort
What is needed Movement of the Lord
Laziness is commendable but there are limits to everything
Look at Clitus in the pillows gray-haired
A tormented pampered patient
He sits all his life with gout and melancholy
The unfortunate day will come suffocating
Groaning he crawls from the bed to the sofa
It sits all day when there is a night fog
The light will dim as it spreads out into the darkness
From the sofa Clit will crawl to the bed
And how will the unfortunate man spend the night
In a peaceful sleep in a pleasant dream
No sleep is not a joy for him but a torment
Not with poppies and a heavy hand
Morpheus will close his languid eyes
And slowly they pass by in succession
For the poor man the hours of the gloomy night
I don't want to be a mutual friend of Bertu
Prescribe you heavy movements
The stubborn plow of hunting pleasure
No I will invite a sloth into the grove
My friends how beautiful the morning is here
In the silence of the fields through the mystery of the oak groves
How the young day shines proudly clear
It all gets brighter overtaking each other
The streams murmur the banks shine the silence
There is still dew on the fresh grass
The waves of golden lakes slumber motionlessly
My friends take up your staff
Go into the forest and wander through the valley
Get tired of steep hills at the top
And in the long night your sleep will be deep
As soon as the shadow covers the sky
Let the joy of our life enter
God of joy with a wide full cup
And Bacchus reigns with his whole court
Feast moderately with him
Three glasses in hissing waves
Pour yourself some more rosy wines
But a fat lump with puffy cheeks
Don't come knocking at the door
I'm glad to see him but only at lunch
And I'll clean it up in a friendly manner at noon
His gifts but right in the evening
I am much more friendly with his neighbor
Do not dine that is the holy law
Who values light sleep most
Beware of wise laziness children
The deceptive shadow of reassurance
Don't sleep during the day about woe woe to you
When you get used to napping by the clock
That your peace is deeply insensitive
The true dream from you has already given eco
You don't know a happy dream
Your whole century of unbearable languor
And sleep is boring and waking up is boring
And the days flow amidst eternal darkness
But if in the wilderness near a waterfall
What is seething and boiling under the mountain
A lovely sleep is a reward for fatigue
At the sound of the waves on the wild shore the
Covers the gaze with a misty veil
Will hug you with a quiet hand
On the soft moss will bow down and overshadow
Oh how sweet is oblivion near the noisy waters
May your peace last longer
I envy the happy man's pleasure
Have you ever had a stormy time
On a winter day in the late quiet light
To sit alone in the office without a candle
All is quiet around there are no more birches
The light of the windows gets darker hour by hour
There is some kind of ghost wandering on the ceiling
The coal and bluish smoke turn pale
As light steam curls up into the chimney
And now with his invisible staff
Morpheus casts an unfaithful darkness over everything
Candide's gaze darkens from your hands
Having closed himself he suddenly fell to his knees
You sighed and your hand fell onto the table
And the head rolls from the shoulder to the chest
You are dozing above you the blood of peace
An unexpected dream is more pleasant than many dreams
The magical healer of mental anguish
My friend Morpheus is my long-time comforter
I have always loved to sacrifice for you
And you blessed the priest long ago
Will I forget that golden time
Will I forget the blissful hour of bliss
When in the corner in the evening hiding
I called and waited for you in peace
I myself am not happy with my talkativeness
But I love the memories of my childhood years
Oh should I keep silent about my mother
About the charm of mysterious nights
When in a cap in an old robe
She deflects the spirits with prayer
He will cross me with zeal
And he will tell me in a whisper
About the dead about the exploits of Bova
I couldn't move from horror
Barely breathing I press myself under the blanket
Feeling neither legs nor head
Under the image is a simple clay night light
Slightly illuminated the deep wrinkles
Dear antique great-grandmother's cap
And a long mouth where two teeth were chattering
Everything instilled an involuntary fear in the soul
I trembled and finally quietly
The languor of sleep fell upon my eyes
Then in a crowd from the azure heights
On a tray of roses winged dreams
The sorcerers and sorceresses flew away
My sleep was bewitched by deceptions
I was lost in a rush of sweet thoughts
In the wilderness of the forest among the Murom deserts
I met the dashing Polkans and Dobrynya
And the young mind was carried away by imaginations
But you passed through the night serenely
And the age of youth has already arrived
Give me Alban's delicate brushes
And I tasted the dream of youthful love
And where was she born Delights
And at that very moment she was consumed by delight
I woke up and looked for day in the sky
But the moon is still silent hidden in the darkness
And around me is the shadow of deep night
But my sleep is quiet carefree son of Parnassus
In the silence of the night I don’t struggle with rhyme
I never see Phoebus or Pegasus
Not the old courtyard of some old muses
I am not a hero I do not yearn for laurels
I don't trade in peace and bliss
I don't imagine a terrible battle at night
I'm not a rich man and I'm a barking gatekeeper
Didn't disturb my pleasant dreams
I am not a villain with anxiety and melancholy
I don't see bloody ghosts in my dreams
The murderous children of prejudice
And in the late hour a terrible pale Fear
Don't frown sullenly in your head
Recently in the dark times
When the desert moon
Flowed along a foggy path
I saw a girl at the window
One sat thoughtfully
The chest breathed in secret fear
She looked with excitement
On the dark path under the hills
I whispered here hastily
And the maiden with a trembling hand
She opened the window timidly
The moon was covered in darkness
I said “Lucky one” with longing
There is only one fun waiting for you
When in the evening
And a window will open for me
Bless the poet In the silence of the Parnassian canopy
I bowed my knees before the muses with trembling
He flew along a dangerous path with hope
Phoebus drew my lot and the lyre is my destiny
I fear the inexperienced inglorious fall
But I am not able to subdue the ardent attraction
I do not heed the terrible sentence of death
The sacred judge hidden in the centuries
Faithful guardian of past years beloved confidant of the Muses
And the unshakable object of pale envy
He encouraged me with his friendly attention
And Dmitrev praised the weak gift with a smile
And our glorious elder the chosen singer of the kings
Crowned by Winged Genius and Grace
He hugged me with a trembling hand in tears
And he predicted happiness for me that I did not know
And you are doomed by nature to songs
Wasn't it you who gave me your hand in a sacred covenant of love
Can I forget the hour when I was in front of you
I stood silent and like a lightning stream
The soul flew to your exalted soul
And secretly united in raptures it blazed
No no I decided to go on a difficult journey without fear
The chest was filled with courageous faith
Creators are immortal pets of inspiration
You show me the goal in the mists of the distance
I fly to the unknown with a brave dream
And it seems that your Genius has rushed over me
But what is under the formidable Parnassian rock
What a sight opened before me
In the terrible darkness of the cave depths
The sullen sons of enmity and envy
The exalted creators of Zoila's notes
The fighting squads of nonsense are sitting
Far away the sharp howl of wild lyres is carried
Varangian verses squeal Varangian formation
Laughter is their common answer over the gloomy crowds
In the darkness two ghosts bowed their heads
One sat on piles of prose and poetry
The heavy fruits of midnight labors
The forgotten graves of the deceased poems
The feeble stop-folder listens to the howl with a smile
Before him the torn-apart Tilimakh groans
The iron pen creaks in his fingers
And pulls dry hexameters along with it
Spondees are rigid and dactyls are tight
The singer renowned by his zealous Muse
Be proud of yourself Mevia you inflated specimen
But who else is in the smoke of mad smoking
Stands among the crowd of friends of ignorance
The noise of solemn praise rushes towards him
And he trampled both Taste and Mind with rhyme
Are you this weak child of other people's lessons
The envious proud cold Sumarokov
Without strength without fire with a mediocre mind
Owing his crown to prejudice
And from Pindus thrown down and cursed by Racine
How can a dwarf compete with a giant
Is it for him to dispute that laurel crown
In which our immortal singer shone
The joy of Russians is a midnight wonder
No in the quiet Summer he will drown silently
There is already a seal of oblivion on his forehead
What could he convey to future centuries
Grace was afraid of the cynical pipe
And the rough fingers on the lyre grew ossified
Let Mevius be extolled in speeches
Depreau will appear Chapelin will disappear
And what's funny will always remain funny
Blind ignorance nurtures the ignorant
It hid them in its dark shelter
There they bravely forge prose and poetry
There all the enemies of Science are deaf but not dumb
They print poems in Nikon's style
Some Slavic odes are piling up
Others wheeze in frantic Tragedies
He is faithful to his rebellious union
Having brought the yawning Muse onto the stage
Immortal Geniuses are thought to be torn from Parnassus
The hand shook as his blow slid
In vain he throws himself with an envious dagger
With a couplet he is wounded he is cast into the dust by the Magazine
At the whistles of Criticism he runs to his brothers
And they wove a crown of poppies for Thespis
All hands placed on that Tilimakhida
They swear to take revenge on the employees for their grievances
Excitedly they rise up in a frantic crowd
Woe to those who are born into this world with a sensitive soul
Who could secretly captivate beauties with a gentle lyre
Who boldly whistled with humorous satire
Who speaks truthfully
And he doesn’t want to beat his forehead to Russian Stupidity
He is an enemy of the Fatherland he is a sower of debauchery
And speeches rain down on the opponent
And you Parnassian priests rise up
Singers are brought up by nature and work
In the happy heresy of both Taste and Teaching
Strike down the impudent friends of the Unenlightened
Avenger of Genius friend of the true poet
Pouring down from heaven both life and eternal light
The right hand of Apollo is the arrow of death
Finally defeats the terrible Python
Look struck by hostile arrows
With an extinguished torch and motionless wings
The spirit of Ozerov calls to you for revenge
You have an insulted taste you have been given a message of knowledge
Fly to your enemies and Phoebus and the Muses are with you
Strike the barbarians with bloody verses
Ignorance having humbled itself will lower its cold gaze
An illiterate cathedral of arrogant rhetoricians
But I see that it is dangerous to proclaim truths to us
Meviy frowned at me terribly
And the death sentence thundered for talents
Is it my lot to endure persecution
What needs boldly into the distance along the straight road
Having given a hand to learning supported by you
Their malice does not frighten me firm Karamzin
You are an example to me What is the cry of these mad squads
Let the outcasts of Phoebus converse
They have not received a gift of prose or poetry from heaven
Their glory is their shame their creation is laughter to the mind
And those who arose in darkness will fall into darkness
The noise of the field flute rose
My solitude is announced
And with the image of a precious mistress
The last dream has flown away
The shadow of night has already rolled down from the sky
The dawn has risen the pale day is shining
And around me there is a deafening desolation
She's gone I was on the shores
Where did my dear go on a clear evening
On the shore on the green meadows
I didn't find any barely visible traces
Left by her beautiful foot
Thoughtfully wandering in the depths of the forests
I pronounced the name of the incomparable
I called her and her lonely voice
Empty valleys called her into the distance
Attracted by dreams he came to the stream
Its streams flowed slowly
The unforgettable image did not tremble in them
She is gone until the sweet spring
I said goodbye to bliss and to my soul
Already autumn's cold hand
The heads of birches and lindens are bare
She rustles in the deserted oak groves
There day and night a yellow leaf whirls
There is a fog on the cooled waves
And the instant whistle of the wind is heard
Fields hills familiar oak groves
Guardians of sacred silence
Witnesses of my longing fun
You are forgotten until the sweet spring
When the last hour of happiness struck
When I woke up in tears over the abyss
And trembling for the last time
I touched your hand with my lips
Yes I remember everything my heart was horrified
But he drowned out the unbearable sadness
I said Not eternal separation
All joys are now carried away into the distance
Let's forget ourselves in dreams the flour will drown
Despondency is a destructive boredom
The hermit's shelter will not be visited
The Muse will meet my sorrow with delight
I will be consoled by the quiet glance of friendship
My soul's cold darkness will be illuminated
How little I knew love and the heart
The hours go by and the days pass by
But sorrows bring no consolation
And the phials do not carry oblivion
Oh my dear you are with me everywhere
But I am sad and secretly I am sad
Will the day shine behind the blue mountain
Will the night rise with the autumn moon
I'm still looking for you my lovely friend
Will I fall asleep I only dream of you
I see only you in my wrong dreams
I think about it and involuntarily call upon it
I listen to your voice it is audible to me
Absentmindedly I sit among friends
I can't hear their noisy conversation
I look at them with motionless eyes
My cold gaze will no longer recognize them
And you and I became sad about Lyra
Confidant of my sick soul
The sad dull ringing of your string
And only the voice of love you have not forgotten
O faithful sadness sadness with me
Let your careless chants
They will depict my despondency
And listening to your clanking
Let the thoughtful maidens sigh
Since ancient times the wise have sought
Forgotten traces of Truth
And they talked for a long time
Old talk of old men
They said the Truth is naked
She secretly went into the well
And drinking water together
They shouted: We'll find her here
But someone is a benefactor of mortals
And almost old man Silenus
Their important stupidity is a witness
Tired of water and screaming
Left our invisible
I thought of wine first
And having drained the cup to the last drop
Saw the Truth at the Bottom
Deep in the night in the fields
The blankets have been lying there for a long time
And faintly in the pale clouds
The desert star shone
At the dying lights
In the uncertain darkness of the fog
The two camps stood silently
On the darkened heights
All that sleeps is only the rebellious murmur of the waves
It spreads in the silence of the night
Yes it can be heard from a deaf distance
The ringing of steel and the clatter of horses
A crowd of young riders
In the oak grove rides silently
Their horses tremble and puff up
They shake their heads impatiently
The horsemen are already rushing across the field
Having left the oak grove shelter unsteadily
Horses are petted and tamed
And they whisper with a proud smile
Their faces are glowing with joy
The angry eyes burn with fire
Only you are a warlike poet
As sad as the gloom of midnight
And pale as autumn light
With his head bowed gloomily
With hidden sorrow in my chest
Carried away by sad thoughts
He rides silently ahead
Singer is gloomy what's wrong with you
You are sad before the fight alone
Bowed his fearless head
He lowered his reins and saber
Am I really a slave to idle bliss
May peace be a joy to your soul
Than our stormy raids
And at night the battle clash of swords
The path of war may be dangerous
Our proud destiny is enviable
Is death terrible to you now
You never turned pale in the midst of battles
We saw you under swords
With a calm bold brow
Always between the first rows
Wherever there was thunder in battle
With a victorious uniting cry
Your voice sang our glory
And now you are in wild despondency
How the fugitive warrior became speechless
But slowly the sad singer
He raised his head and gaze
He looked gloomily into the distant gloom
And with a sigh he shook his chest
Deep sleep in the valley of battle
Alone we rush in the darkness of the night
I have a premonition of the desired end
The last battle calls me
I will break the chain of cruel fate
I will drag my brothers into the fire
I'll be carried away by a thunderstorm and alone
My horse will run out into the valley
About you who are here with me
The grave boundary has been laid
Tell me my dear with tears
Will your long sleep sweeten you
But for me no one breathes
Silence will overtake me
Elvina will hear the news of death
And she will not sigh secretly
And you are protected by the Fates
For the happiness of life's joys
Let the lovers shed tears
Your return will be blessed
For a cup of sweet salvation
Oh brothers remember the singer
His love his torment
And the glory of the terrible end
Happy is he who is in passion for himself
He dares to admit it without fear
Who in an unknown fate
A timid hope cherishes
Who is the moon's misty ray
Leads into the voluptuous midnight
To whom quietly the faithful key
Will open the door to his beautiful
But I don't have any in my dull life
The joys of secret pleasures
The early flower of hope has faded
The flower of life dries up from torment
Sadly youth will fly away
I will hear the threats of old age
But I am forgotten by love
Will I forget the tears of my love
Why are you leaving the cloud
Lonely Moon
And onto the pillows through the windows
You cast a dim glow
With its gloomy appearance
You awaken sad dreams
Love's vain suffering
And with my proud mind
Slightly lulled desires
Fly away memories
Sleep unhappy love
That night will never happen again
When the calm glow
Your mysterious rays
Through the dark ash tree it penetrated
And it was pale pale lit up
The beauty of my mistress
What are you delights of lust
Before the secret charm of joy
Direct love direct happiness
Will joys rush back
What minutes did you fly
Then in such a quick succession
And the light shadows thinned out
Before the unexpected dawn
Why did you roll away for a month
And drowned in the bright sky
Why did the morning ray flash
Why did I say goodbye to my sweetheart
Have you heard the voice of the night beyond the grove
Singer of love singer of his sorrow
When the fields were silent in the morning hour
The sound of the flute is sad and simple
Have you heard
Have you ever met in the deserted darkness of the forest
Singer of love singer of his sorrow
Have you noticed the sad smile
Or a quiet gaze filled with longing
Have you met
Did you sigh listening to the quiet voice
Singer of love singer of his sorrow
When did you see a young man in the woods
Meeting the gaze of his dull eyes
Did you sigh
A dear and old acquaintance
Oh my good sleep guardian
Where are you Under the desert roof
The bed is already laid out for me in peace
In the silent silence of the night
Come blow out my lamp
Bless my dreams
Just give me some joy until the morning
My painful love
Hide from sad memory
Separation is a sad sentence
Let me see your sweet gaze
Let me hear your sweet voice
When will the darkness of the night pass away
And you will leave my eyes
Oh if only the soul could
Forget love until the next night
I listened to Lila at the keyboard
Her lovely languid voice
A magical sadness caresses us
Like the breeze of Zephyr at night
Tears fell from the eyes
And I told the sweet singer
Your sad voice is magical
But the word of my dear
More magical than Lila's gentle songs
Love is the only joy of a cold life
Love alone is the torment of hearts
She gives only one joyful moment
And there is no end in sight to the sorrows
A hundred times blessed is he who in his charming youth
This quick moment will be caught on the fly
Who to the joys and bliss of the unknown
Beauty will bow down to the bashful
But who has not sacrificed himself for love
You are free singers of feelings
You humbled your soul before your loved ones
You sang with passion and proud hand
The beauties were given their crowns
Blind Cupid is cruel and biased
I gave you thorns and myrtles
In agreement with the Permes queens
To the joy of others of you I pointed out
He bound others forever with sorrows
And as a gift he sent the fire of unhappy love
The Heirs of Tibullus and Parni
You know the priceless sweetness of life
Like the morning ray your days shine
Singers of love sing the joy of youth
With lips bowed to burning lips
Die in the arms of your mistresses
Poems of love quietly sigh
I don't dare to envy you anymore
Singers of love you have known sorrows
And your days flowed through thorns
You called for your end with excitement
The end has come in the distance of life
You didn't see the momentary fun
But not having found the bliss of your days
You have at least met fame
And by your torment you are immortal
This is not the fate that has been destined for me
Under the gloomy canopy of clouds
In the wilderness of the valleys in the sad darkness of the forests
I wander alone sad and gloomy
In the evening hour over the gray lake
In tears of anguish I often moan
But the murmur of the waves to my lamentations
And the noise of the oak groves in response only I listen
Will the cold sleep of the soul be interrupted
Will poetry's rapture be kindled
The heat is born and it cools down quietly
The fruitless inspiration passes
Let her become famous for something else
One loves he loves and is loved
I love I love but it won't touch her anymore
She will not smile at the voice of the sufferer
His verses are careless and simple
Why should I sing under the field maple
I left it to the desert zephyr
The lyre that was abandoned forever
And the weak gift disappeared like light smoke
I saw death she sat in silence
At my peaceful threshold
I saw the coffin and its door opened
The soul has faded and grown cold
I will soon leave my friends
And my sorrowful life
No one will notice any traces anymore
The last glance of my eyes
Will not meet the ray of immortality
And the dying lamp of young days
The quiet darkness of insignificance will illuminate
Forgive me sad world where the path is dark
Over the abyss lay for me
Where quiet faith did not console me
Where I loved where I can't love
Forgive me luminary of the day forgive me curtain of heaven
The silent darkness of the night is the sweet hour of the morning star
Familiar hills of the stream desert voice
The silence of the mysterious forest
And forgive me for the last time
And you who were my god in the world
The subject of secret tears and sorrows is the pledge
Forgive me everything is past my flame is already dying out
I'll go to a cold grave
And the fatal gloom of death
With the torments of love will cover the sad life
And you friends when you are deprived of strength
Barely breathing in painful struggle
I'll tell you about my friend I loved
And the quiet spirit will die in exhaustion
My friends then go to her
Tell me he is taken by eternal darkness
And maybe about my fate
She will sigh over the coffin urn
My days drag on slowly
And every moment in the sad heart multiplies
All the sorrows of unhappy love
And all the dreams of madness disturb
But I am silent my murmur is not heard
I shed tears tears are my consolation
My soul is captivated by longing
In them the bitter finds pleasure
About life an hour of flying I don’t feel sorry for you
Disappear into the darkness empty ghost
The torment of my love is dear to me
Let me die but let me die loving
What are funny friends for
My silence disturbs you
Singing the last farewell
My Muse has already fallen silent
In vain did I take the lyre in my hands
To jingle joyfully at feasts
And on weakened strings
I was looking for lost sounds
The gods have given you more
Golden days golden nights
And they are aimed at love
Eyes filled with fire
Play sing oh friends
Lose the fleeting evening
And your carefree joy
I will smile through my tears
I thought that love had died out forever
That in the heart of evil passions the rebellious voice has fallen silent
That friendship is finally a joyful star
The sufferer was brought to a safe haven
I thought I was resting near the safe shores
Look from afar and point with your hand
On the sail of the disastrous swimmers
Carried by a furious storm
And I said A hundred times blessed
Whose age is free and beautiful
How the century of spring rushed by clear
And was not darkened by passion
Who has not suffered in vain love
Who does not know the sad captivity
Blessed but I am more blessed
I broke the chain of torment
Again I am at liberty in friendship
And the gloomy field of life
The cheerful shine charmed
But what did I say unhappy man
For a minute I fell asleep in the uncertain silence
But a dark love lurked within me
My passionate flame did not go out
Called by joy into the crowd of my friends
I wanted to tune the frisky lyre back to its former tune
I also wanted to sing the praises of young beauties
The Joy of Bacchus and Delphiru
In vain I was silent my hand was tired
Lying languidly on a naughty lyre
I was still burning and indifferently sad
I watched the games of my youth from afar
Love is the poison of our days
Run with the crowd of deceptive dreams
Don't burn my soul
Fire of painful desires
Fly away ghosts Cupid I am not yours anymore
Give me joy give me my peace
Leave me alone in the senseless nature
Or let me fly on the wings of hope
Let me sleep again in heavy chains
Dreaming of sweet freedom
In boring captivity it fades away
Barely developed flower of life
Youth flies away stealthily
And the trace of her sadness is a trace
From the moments of senseless birth
Until the tender years of youth
I still don't know pleasure
And there is no happiness in a languid heart
From the threshold of life into the distance
I looked impatiently
There there I dreamed of pleasure
But I was flying after a ghost
Developing golden wings
With magical tender beauty
Love appeared young
And flew before me
I follow a distant goal
But he didn't achieve his sweet goal
When lit by joy
A quick moment of happiness will come
When it flares up in radiance
The dim lamp of youthful days
And my dark path will be illuminated
With the smile of my companion
Yesterday Masha ordered me
To sketch rhymes into couplets
And she promised me as a reward
Thank you in prose write
I hasten to carry out the order
Years dare not wait
Another seven years and a promise
You may not fulfill it
You sit quietly and decorously with your hands folded
You will sit in meetings
And sacrificing to the goddess of boredom
To fly from the station to the masquerade
And you won't remember the poet
Oh Masha Masha hurry up
And for four verses to me
Write my reward
Amber cup
Full for a long time
With steam room foam
The wine sparkles
Light is more expensive
It's for the heart
Well for whom
I'll drink some wine
Drink to glory
Slava's friends
Scolding fun
It's not me who loves
This is fun
It's not funny
Friendship hangover
Thunder is running
You are Helikon
Long-time residents
For Apollo
Drink singers
Frisky Kameny
Weasels trouble
Current of Hippocrene
Other water
Drink to joy
Young love
Youth will disappear
My children
Amber cup
Full for a long time
I am grateful
I drink to wine
To you Venus' confidante
Which Cupid is for you
And the frisky children of Cythera
They decorated the throne with flowers
Which gentle examples
Smile eyes gentle tone
More eloquent than Voltaire
They preach the law to us
And Aristipov and Glycera
A warm bow to you
A wreath of love and the ringing of lyres
Despising Plato's chimeras
I am saved by your holiness
And he became an apostle of wise faith
Anacreon and Ninon
All but a certain measure
I see Zeno frowning
And his entire gray retinue
And the wise friend of wine Cato
And the boring slave of Epaphroditus
Seneca even Cicero
They shout: You are lying profane torment
Direct mortal pleasure
Friends agree crying and moaning
Of course it's a hundred times better than laughter
To endure is a great joy
Your advice is not funny at all
But I don't need him you hear
Because he is too wise
A good dinner is more precious to me
Three dozen philosophers
I am not seduced by you
The cathedral is gloomy and angry
But let them shout at the enemy
Their dispute is only a waste of time
Who is seduced by their example
I love good Socrates
He lived in peace he was smart
With his feigned importance
He loved feasts theaters and women's parties
He was in love by the way
And in Aspasia's restroom
Plato himself is a witness to this
The slave is timid and submissive
He sighed frequently into his tunic
And to her with a courtly smile
Whispered All is a ghost a lie and a dream
And wisdom and people and Glory
Well truly one Zabava
Believe me love is not a dream
So he burned incense for the beautiful one
And poor Xanthippe with her
Your husband is Aristipus' partner
I was raised to heaven
Meanwhile the dear ones are barking menacingly
The Evil Cynic despises bliss
One is deprived of all joys
Breathed excommunicated from the world
But wandering with an empty barrel
Following the blind Wisdom
The empty eccentric was blinded
And scooping water with your hand
He couldn't scoop up happiness
Today are good husbands
I will amuse you with a new fairy tale
Did you know my friends
A blind boy with a bandage
Phoebus have mercy on the blind man
Cupid is not blind at all my friends
But his pranks are his fun
He wanted to oh the wicked one
To make people laugh and to spite them
His Folly led
Foolishness leads Cupid
But soon my God
The goddess is a fool and I'm tired of it
I don't know exactly why
I've come up with a new idea
Taking off the blindfold from the dear eyes
The prankster goes to Hymen
And what is Hymen
He is one of the children of Cyprus
Poor thing decrepit and lazy
Cold sad silent
Grumbling and dozing for a whole century
And by the way he is a good man
Yes he has a jealous nature
God is sad from jealousy
I couldn't even sleep peacefully
I was still afraid of my little brother
I was spying on him secretly
And he kept watch over his adversary
Wandering forever with a lantern
Here my boy comes up to him
And he starts a treacherous speech
Have mercy brother Hymen
What is this I am ashamed my dear
And our quarrel is useless
And your eternal cowardice
Well let's make peace be smarter
Let's forget our hateful discord
But just look forever
Take this bandage as a keepsake my dear
And give me your lantern
And what did the sad god believe
Cupid jumped for joy
And with all his might he looked at his eyes
I've tightened the reins for my brother
Since then mysterious glances
No longer afraid of beauty
Sad patrols are not scary
No waking up at night
He is calm but his brother is treacherous
Joking about honor and about him
The war is being waged by the ungrateful
With his blind ally
Only sleep falls upon mortals
Cupid in the silence of the night
The lantern is handed over to the lover
And he himself sees off the lucky one
To the sleeping husband's house
Himself from the careless Hymen
He guards the secret door
Please my friend Elena
Believe the wise tale
When to worship
I went to ancient Paphos
Believe me I saw it
In Venus's restroom
Phial of Anacreon
He was filled with Bacchus
With brightening moisture
There were roses hanging all around
Green ivy and myrtles
Intertwined by hand
Queens of pleasures
I saw it on the edge
The treacherous Cupid
He looked sadly
On foamy moisture
What are you looking at you little rascal
On foamy moisture
I asked Cupid
Tell me that it has calmed down
Or do you want to scoop up some
Golden wine for you
But the pen won't reach it
"No" the little one answered
I frolic in this sea
Quiver and bow and arrows
I didn't leave everything on purpose
But I can't swim
There they are shining at the bottom
Oh I feel sorry listen
Get them for me from there
Oh no I told God
Thank you for falling
Let them stay there
The naughty one crowned by Erata and Venus
Are you luring a prisoner into your domain
In a peaceful estate between Pindus and Cythera
Where Sholie was lounging with Meletsky and Parni
You are Apollo's spoiled pet
To match their singing with the playful flute
Fun and the Nymphs of Helicon
Your happy cradle was rocked
And now in my beautiful youth
Your faithful companions are with you
Ring O Troubadour on the voluptuous harp
Early dream of love
Sing the boiling desire of the young heart
The stubborn trembling of your beauty
The envious veil torn from the chest
The last murmur of modesty
And the triumph of passion on a bed of flowers
Sing in bliss fixing your languid eyes on the maiden
Her magical beauty
In the arms of love lost nights
Bliss fast hours
My friend she is yours she is your reward
The priceless joy of mysterious love
Dare I sing of you
When suffering oppresses me
When for every dream
Dark despondency leaves its mark
No no love friends with an open soul
In silence feel captivated by beauty
This is my lot I am ready to follow it
I submit to fate but have mercy on me
Don't ask me for poetry
You can't bask in the charming dazzle forever
I already see the tiresome light of cold truth
In the kindness of my soul I believed in rapture
You are a poet who whispered to the Sorceress-Dream
And disregarding wisdom threats and advice
With casual ease he strung together the couplets
He amused himself with an innocent toy
Bacchus's Servant with Merry Friends
Sometimes he sang wine in water verses
In bad poems he scolded bad writers
Or he wove a wreath for Friendship and friendship yawned
And sleepily he recited sleepy poems
And I even repent that I a hermit have sinned
I was the first to sing the innocent beginning of love
But so mysterious with such an analysis of words
With such bashful modesty
That without blushing timidly
Even the virgin Kozlov would have listened to me
But the Parnassian amusements were hidden from me
I was not put to sleep for long
I did not dream for long of the dreams of the Muses and Glory
I am involuntarily awakened by strict experience
Having fallen asleep among the roses on the thorns I woke up
I saw that there is no genius seal yet
The mortal hunt for rhymes to babble
Comparing your poems with mine made me smile
And I have enough writing
Dreams dreams
Where is your sweetness
Where are you where are you
Night joy
He disappeared
A happy dream
And lonely
In the deep darkness
I am awakened
Around the bed
Silent Night
They instantly cooled down
They flew away in an instant
Away in a crowd
Dreams of love
Still full
Soul of Desire
And catches sleep
Memories
Love love
Let him be intoxicated
I will fall asleep again
Bewitched
And in the morning
Tired again
Let me die
Unawakened
I'm not that passionate Philosopher
That I was able to love like this before
My spring and summer are red
Gone to the ends of the earth
Cupid light of golden age
I honored you more than all the gods
Oh if only I were born again
Would I serve you like that
Oh dear Delia
Hurry up my beauty
Golden Star of Love
Ascended to heaven
The moon rolled silently
Hurry your Argus has departed
And sleep closed his eyes
Under the shadow of the secret
Oakwood Silence
Where the current is solitary
Silver waves
Murmurs with sad Philomela
The shelter of joyful love is ready
And illuminated by the moon's brilliance
The shadows of night will fall
Cover us with your own
And the shades of the grove slumber
And quickly a moment of love
I'm flying all ablaze with desire
Hurry up to see Delia
Hurry into my arms
Are you in front of me
My Delia
Separated from you
How much I cried
Are you in front of me
Or a dream is a dream
Seduced me
Did you recognize your friend
He wasn't that
But you are a friend
Still haven't forgotten
And the sad one repeats
Am I loved by my sweetheart
As it used to be
What can compare now
With my share
Here comes a tear rolling down
On your cheek
Delia is ashamed
What can compare now
With my share
Happy fifteenth spring
Like a lily at dawn
The beauty is blooming
And languid breathing
And the languid light of gazes
And the trembling of the chest
And the delicate color of roses
All youth changes
It doesn't captivate Lilu anymore
Merry round dance
Alone by the sleepy waters
She hides in the forests
Sighs and languishes
And Eros is there with her
When on a dark night
Her in a modest bed
A quiet sleep will overtake you
With a sorceress dream
And with quiet melancholy
He will fulfill the heart
And Lila in a dream
Enjoys pleasure
And whispers O Philo
Who's there in the dark cave
In the evening time
Bound by languid laziness
Rest in peace with you
So you have already tasted
All the joys of love
Do you feel about Leela
Excitement in the blood
And with trembling confusion
With a burning face
You breathe with rapture
Cupid under the wing
O victim of tender passion
Burn in silence
Rest in peace
Until the fiery dawn
For you the flow is playful
Clothed in gloomy darkness
And the month is silent
A foggy light is pouring
Here the roses are bent
Above you in the dark shelter
And the winds hid
Where love reigns
But who is there near the cave
Lies in the thick grass
On the altar of Venus
He looks with annoyance
Bent down between the flowers
Shaggy leg
Above the sad eyes
Two horns hung over
To Faun is a gloomy resident
Forests and steep mountains
The Pesky Persecutor
Young shepherds
Cupid's Favorite
Beautiful Philo
He has been a rival for a long time
In the shelter of lust
He hears sighs of happiness
And the languid groan of bliss
In silence the unhappy
Drinks from the cup of suffering
And in vain jealousy
Shedding bitter tears
But here is the queen of the nights
Rolled behind the forests
And the silent morning star
Blushes the skies
The marshmallows whispered
And a faun in a dense forest
Runs to hide sorrows
In the gorges of the wild mountains
One morning Lila
With unsteady feet
In the middle of a dense grove
She walked thoughtfully
Oh how soon will the darkness of night
With a beautiful moon
You will conquer the sky
Oh how soon will the dark forest
You'll turn blue in the fog
In the west of the sky
But there is a rustling sound behind the bushes
She hears a dull voice
And suddenly his eyes flashed
Before her is the forest god
Like a spring breeze
She flies into the forest
He's chasing her
And the trembling Lila
All secrets revealed
Of her youthful beauty
And the tender breast opened up
Kissing the breeze
And a slender leg
Unwittingly exposed herself
Fluttering over the grass
The shepherdess breathes timidly
And Faun with him
He hears closer and closer
She already feels it
The fire of his breath
All efforts are in vain
You are destined for the Faun
But the noisy wave
She hid the beauty
The river is her grave
No Lila is saved
Eros golden-winged
And gentle Cupid
To help young Lila
They fly from all sides
Everyone abandoned Cythera
And the peaceful ones ate Venus
On the trembling waves
They carry it to the cave
The desert temple of love
The lucky guy was already there
And now with Philo
She drinks joy
And with a light groan of passion
The silence was broken
Lila is dozing peacefully
On roses there is negligence and sleep
And she extinguished her beam
There is a moon behind the cloud
Hanging my head
The unfortunate god of the forests
Alone with the evening darkness
Wandered along the shores
Forgive love and joy
He said with a sigh
To waste youth in sadness
I am doomed by fate
Suddenly a ruddy man came out of the forest
Staggering in front of him
The satyr showed up drunk
With a circular jug
He looked at me with dim eyes
I was looking for a way home
And goat's legs
I barely stepped over it
I was walking and walking and came across
On my Faun
He recoiled with laughter
Leaned on him
Are you this dear brother
The gray-haired Satyr cried out
In what unknown country
I met you
Ah said the Faun sadly
My days have faded
Everything has changed for me
I am unhappy in love
What I hear from Cupid
You suffer and are sad
The little troublemaker
And you idolize
Is it possible that oblivion will come
Draw some from the jug
And a cup of consolation
Fill it over the top
And the foam sparkled
And it hisses at the edges
And from the first vial
Cupid is already forgotten
Who is the bold one who owns it
With your beauty
Unfaithful who dares
With a burning hand
Wander through the passionate chest
To languish and sigh
And with the beautiful Lila
To die in raptures
So you cheated
Beauty captivate
Hurry to love O Lila
And change again
The raptures of happiness have passed
Like a light sleep in the morning
Where are the secrets of lust
Where is gentle Palemon
Oh Lila the roses are withering
Minutes of love
Know sadness and tears
And now pluck the thorns
In a destructive striving
Year after year flies by
And old age is in the distance
The beauty is in danger
Cupid already bows
Parted with beauty
And following Cupid
The swarm of fun has disappeared
A shepherdess wanders in the forest
Sad and alone
Who does he find there
Suddenly she sees the Faun
The Goat-legged Philosopher
He was lying under a linden tree
And the foamy phial
Decorating the horns with a wreath
Lazily drained
Although Faun is not a find
For Lila the previous children
But the beauty decided to
Spread the net of love
Creeped up and rushed
A languid gaze on the Faun
And I heard I was leaning
Towards the end of the conversation
But the Faun with an evil smile
Foam your phial
Shaking his head
He told the beauty
No Lila I'm at peace
Catch the others my friend
There is a time for love
For wisdom something else
I used to be with you
In madness I was captivated
I used to admire it
With insidious beauty
And the heart is smoldering with passion
I was drawn to you
It happened but fortunately
What's done is done
Oh have mercy on me
Comrades friends
I'll be a dashing beauty
I'm completely exhausted
I am sad all the time
My fate is bitter
Bring the circle
Open the cellars
It's stored there in the ice
The proud line of bottles
And the porter is hidden
Discharged barrel
We are Liber stuttering
He will show the way to it
Let's all go staggering
Fall asleep under the barrels
They are the comfort of the heart
Award for singers
And oblivion of the torments of love
And the heat of my poems
Walking home from the all-night vigil in the evening
Antipyevna and Marfushka scolded
Antipyevna was extremely hot-tempered
Wait he shouts I'll handle you
You think I've already forgotten
That night when having climbed into a corner
You were naughty with your godson Vanyushka
Wait hubby will find out about everything
Should I threaten you Marfushka answers
Vanyusha what He's still a child
And your matchmaker Trofim
Day and night the whole city knows it
Shut up godmother and you like me are a sinner
You can offend anyone with words
You see a straw in someone else's
And you don’t even see a log in yourself
When the poet is delighted
Reads you his ode or congratulatory poems
When the narrator draws out a sentence
When you listen to a parrot
Finding nothing to laugh about
You fall asleep and yawn into your handkerchief
You wait for the moment when you can say
Goodbye
But alone with his beauty
Or among smart people
True happiness comes alive
You become happy laugh and eat
Prolong your peaceful vigils
And sing at the end of the evening
To your friends to your bottles
Goodbye
Friends life is fleeting
And everything floats away with time
Love is also a flyer
The bird of our spring
Too soon she disappears laughing furtively
And goodbye forever Nadezhda
When she flies away you can't say more
Goodbye
Time flies sadly and cruelly
And sooner or later you go to the next world
Sometimes it happens not so rarely
Chance saves us from the grave
The hordes of suffering are removed
And a black terrible skeleton
Goes off to knock on other doors
Goodbye
But what I feel is that I'm tired
Tiring my dear listeners
Well I'm coming down from Parnassus
It is not made for singers
I am inspired by the verses
I have power over the chorus
Goodbye pretty pen
Goodbye
With reverent soul
Come closer young traveler
Love for the desert shelter
I was happy with her here once
In fiery delight it went out
And the time is right for us
Stopped for a minute
Here is our little monk
Poet scribe and warrior
Always for everything in all places
He deserves nettles
He is a regular with Martyn Pop
With Frolov the mathematician
Enter Engelhardt the Hero
And in an instant he is a diplomat
God knows why poets and philosophers
I've been angry with you and me for a long time now
I don't argue with their learned crowd
But I have no reason to scold
What gives me joy and peace
What if you weren't mine
What if I wasn't your Nisa
More sickening than an idyll and colder than an ode
From anger a misanthrope from stupidity a poet
How terribly nature has played with you
When I was preparing for the light
You fear people like a black disease
About a pathetic example of an ugly dream
Comfort yourself you evil fool you will not have
Never had a lover or a friend
Forget it my dear Kaverin
The immodest verses of momentary playfulness
I love you first be sure
Your hussar sins
To be known as the apostle of Zeno's teaching
It may be good but neither for you nor for me
I know that passions are agitated
And pranks and delusions
The brilliant spring of our days has arrived
Let it be smart even if careless
We'll fool around sometimes
Without any unnecessary shame for now
We will be able to fool around
Everything has its time everything has its moment
Everything goes in a certain order
A funny and flighty old man
A funny and sedate young man
Having had my fill of life visiting my youthful days
Let's say goodbye forever to the noisy joy
With ardent Venus and capricious Bacchus
Let's sigh about them as friends
And we will surprise Old Age with a silent bow
Now live in carelessness
Love your friends and keep their memories
Pray to Whom and Love
Catch a moment of youth
And despise the rabble's jealous murmuring
She doesn't know that it's possible to live in harmony
With poems with cards with Plato and with a glass
What frisky pranks under a light blanket
And the mind is elevated and the heart can be hidden
Again I am yours young friends
The foggy days of separation have disappeared
And your hands were extended to your brother again
I saw your frisky circle again
You are still the same but your heart is not the same
You are no longer the most precious thing to him
I'm not the same invisible path
The time of carefree gaiety has passed
Gone forever and the fleeting life
The morning ray fades above me
The joy has parted with the soul
Rejected by a jealous fate
Smile laughter playfulness and peace
I forgot all about silent sadness
The veil lies over the young head
In vain do you engage in playful conversation
And with the tenderness of an eloquent soul
Do you want to interrupt my heavy sleep
It's all over and the happy frolicking
The seal has been erased from my soul
To remove gloomy suffering
In vain do you bring me the lyre
The dreams of days gone by have faded away
And the voice died in the insensitive string
I see only sadness before me
I am afraid of the world I am bored with daylight
I'll go to the forests where there is no life
Where is the dead darkness I hate joy
Her minute trace froze in me
You have fallen the leaves of yesterday's rose
Didn't bloom until the monthly rays
My days of joy have flown away
You rushed away tears flowed involuntarily
And I wither in the dark morning of days
O Friendship consign me to oblivion
In silence I submit to fate
Leave me to the torment of my heart
Leave me to the deserts and tears
Lida is my constant friend
Why through light sleep
Often tired of bliss
I hear your quiet moan
Why in happy love
Seeing a terrible dream
A motionless fearful gaze
You are heading into the darkness
Why when I taste
Quick swoon of love
Sometimes I notice
Your secret tears
You listen absentmindedly
My fiery speech
You shake hands coldly
The gaze of your eyes is cold
Oh priceless friend
Will we shed tears forever
Is the dead spouse forever
To call from the grave
Believe me prisoners of the grave
There lies eternal sleep
They don't like the sweet voice anymore
The groan of sorrow is not sad
Spring roses are not for them
The sweetness of the morning is the noise of feasts
Tears of sincere friendship
And the timid call of mistresses
Early your unforgettable friend
He breathed a sigh of death
And intoxicated with bliss
I fell asleep on your chest
The crowned lucky man sleeps
Believe in love we are innocent
No angry jealous person
Will not come from eternal darkness
There is no thunder on a quiet night
And the envious shadow
There will be no lovers close
Calling forth the sleeping day
Oh you who with caustic reproach
Considering gloomy unbelief a vice
Run in horror of the one who from the first years
Madly extinguished the light that comforted the heart
Curb the frenzy of cruel pride
Does he have any right to your leniency
Hear the tears of pity brother groan
The unfortunate man is not a villain he suffers for himself
Who in the world will sweeten the torment of his soul
Alas he was the first to lose consolation
Look at him not where you do every day
Vanity casts a false shadow on everyone
But in the silence of the family under the native roof
In a conversation with friendship or a dark dream
Find him there where the muddy stream is
Passes slowly among the bare fields
Where the mysterious shade of age-old pines
Rustling on the damp moss the eternal shadows bent
Look he wanders with a withered soul
Tormented by my terrible emptiness
Sometimes tears of sadness are shed sometimes tears of regret
In vain does he seek to divert his melancholy
In vain in the splendor of free simplicity
The beauties of nature are open to him
In vain does he cast a sad gaze around himself
The mind seeks the deity but the heart does not find it
Will the blow of deaf Fates overtake him
Will the gift of a moment of happiness suddenly be taken away
In love or in friendship will he embrace betrayal
And they will feel the deceptive price
The son who fell away from faith deprived of all support
He already sees with horror that he is alone in the world
And a powerful hand to him with gifts of peace
Does not extend beyond the world
Misfortunes of Passions and Infirmities sons
We are all condemned to a terrible grave when we are born
The destruction of mortal bonds is ready at any hour
Our age is uncertain day and hour anxiety
When the cold darkness menacingly envelops us
The curtain of eternity is shaken by the hour of death
It's terrible to feel the tears of the last torment
And begin an unknown separation with the world
Then conversing with the untied soul
O Vera you stand at the door of the grave
You quietly illuminate the grave night for her
And encouraged with Hope you let go
But friends are worse than friends
Only Faith finds its joy in silence
Lives the despondent spirit and the heart's expectation
Nastoets says a date has been set
And he a blind sage groans at the coffin
The unfortunate man is separated from the joys of existence
He does not heed the greetings of sweet hope
He approaches the coffin and calls out but there is no answer
Have you seen him in those silent places
Where the sacred ashes of blood relatives and friends smolder
Have you seen him over the cold grave
Where tender Delia's sweet ashes are hidden
Called to the departed by the evening silence
He leaned his insensible head against the cross
Occasionally muffled groans are heard
He cries but not the right streams of tears flow
Which are sweet to the suffering eyes
And the heart is dear to its freedom
But tears of despair but tears of bitterness
In the silence of horror in the madness of frenzy
And yet it trembles under the shade of dark willows
Kneeling at the mother's coffin
There is a young maiden in serene sadness
Raises his painful and tender gaze to the sky
One is illuminated by a misty moon
She appears as an angel of sorrow
He sighs slowly and embraces the grave
Everything is quiet around him but he seems to be listening
The unfortunate man looks at her in silence
Shakes his head trembles and runs
He hurries on but despondency follows him
Does he silently enter the temple of the Most High with the crowd
There it only increases the longing of one's soul
At the magnificent celebration of the ancient altars
At the voice of the shepherd at the sweet singing of the choirs
His torment of unbelief worries him
He does not see the secret god anywhere
With a darkened soul the shrine stands before
Cold to everything and alien to tenderness
With annoyance he listens to the quiet prayer
The lucky ones think he why can't I
Passions raging in humble silence
Forgetting about reason and the weak and strict
With faith alone bow down before God
Vain cry of the heart no no not destined
It is his bliss to know only unbelief
On the path of life in the darkness the leader is sad
Draws the unfortunate to the cold gates of the grave
And what calls him in the desert of the grave
Who knows but there he sees only peace
Blessed is he who from his youth saw before him
Dark twists of two-hilled height
Who lives on the secret path with an innocent soul
I became a prisoner of a dream
The confidant of the gods knows nothing of evil storms
Over him their craft is silent at times
The young Kamens are rocking him
And with a finger on their lips they keep the singer in peace
He heeds the advice of bashful Grace
And feeling the fire in my chest while still young
The ecstatic one sings on a golden lyre
About Delvig poets are happy
My friend and I the singer and my humble way
The goddess of song adorned herself in flowers
And to my young godly breast
The flame of inspiration influenced
In my infancy I knew how to feel
Everything around me was breathing life
The quick mind was fascinated by everything
And I quickly flew past the first line
With what quiet beauty
The minutes of childhood have flown by
Praise be to you oh gods with a powerful hand
Innocence was taken away from the fierce storms of the world
But everything passed and disappeared into the dark distance
Freedom joy admiration
For others youth is a pleasure
She is a dark sadness to me
It's too early to see the bloody sight of envy
And the poison hidden in the darkness of base slander
No no neither happiness nor glory
I won't be blinded Let them beckon
To the brink of destruction of the seduced favorites
The sacred heat has disappeared
The gift of sweet songs to oblivion
And the voice of animated strings
To dust and lyre and crown
Let them not know that he was once a singer
Doomed to sacrifice by enmity and envy
Died in the morning of summer
Like an early flower in the meadow
Kosoy untimely struck down
And I will live quietly in the unknown silence
The terrible offspring will not remember me
And the coffin of the unfortunate in the gloomy wild desert
Oblivion will be overgrown with creeping dodder
You command me to burn with my soul
Give me back the days that have passed
With my evening dawn
Eat my morning
My century passes invisibly
From the circle of Laughter and Grace
Time is telling me to hide
And he takes me by the hand
It will not give us mercy
Who doesn't know how to apply
To my changing years
He only has their misfortunes
To the lucky frisky young ones
Let us leave behind the passions of delusion
We live in the world for two moments
Let's give it to reason alone
You who sweetened sorrows
Of my momentary youth
Love dreams of the first days
Have you already run away forever
We must die twice
Say goodbye to sweet dreams
Here is Death terrible with suffering
What does it mean after not breathing
On my cloudy sunset
In the middle of the desert darkness
I was so sorry for the loss
Sweet dreams of deception
Then my voice was sad
Friendship gave me a hand
She is like a sweetheart to Love
There was only tenderness
I brought her withered roses
Joyful days of youth
And I followed but I shed tears
That he could only follow her
Say Parnassian my father
Is it really the lover of the faithful muses
A singer cannot be gentle
And together with the guard colonel
Is it really the one who sometimes
Burns incense to Apollo for free
For honor he dares not without shame
Burn gunpowder in war with a hussar
And if possible cities
Bellona Muse and Venus
This seems to be the holy faith
Every singer of our days
I go to the Russian Buffler
And to Denis the brave man
But not on Glinka the officer
Quite a flat singer
I don't need his example
You will say Stop chattering
Be a man and not a dragoon
Guard parades drills
All this will not inspire odes
But it will only dry up the soul
And to Marin for the award ceremony
Maybe right behind Cocytus
They will send him to read his works
Listen to my uncle my dear
Go to blind Themis
Or to the oblique diplomacy
My friend write messages to Lida
Leave the sins of war
And in the sweets of peace
Write Senate resolutions
And pentameter verses
And not from a hussar cornet
Take an example from that poet
From the one whose hand
I drew Ermak
In the snows of an unknown light
And the captivity of the mighty Megmet
And a fashionable horn husband
Who by the grace of God
The Minister and the Sweet Singer
He was a model of strict honor
As a sample it will be syllable
Everything is so my dear uncle
Who is honored by human stupidity
Resolves complicated disputes
He who is cunning with his hand is clever
Intertwines with each other
Diplomatic nonsense
And rules our destiny
The peaceful warrior is funny of course
And the epigrams of the most evil
In the famous Christmastide he is worthy
But what is more charming and lively
Wars of battles and fires
Bloody and empty fields
Bivouac of knightly blows
And what is more enviable than days of war
Not too wise mustachioed ones
But in the heart of true hussars
They live in their tents
Far away from fun and pleasures and graces
How the Immortal Coward Horace Lived
In the dark forests of Tibur
They don't know the light of compulsion
They don't know that boredom is fear
They give dinners and battles
They sing and fight
Happy is he who is dear and terrible to the world
About whom for songs for deeds
True praise thunders
Who glorified Mars and Temir
And he hung up the warlike lyre
Between the faithful saber and the saddle
But you are enemies of labor and glory
Phoebus' Pets and Fun
You are friends of peaceful idleness
I'll whisper in your ear you're right
And I agree with you
God created nature for himself
Your own paradise and happiness for fools
Slander of men and fashion
Of course for the ladies' amusement
Concerns for the noble people
Foolishness for everyone but for us
Solitude and freedom
Only a benevolent darkness will dispel
There is a quiet veil above us
And time will move towards midnight
The arrow of the slow clock
When you don't sleep in the silence of nature
One happy love
Then my dungeon again
I will leave the silent vaults
The remaining minutes are flying
The loss is too painful for me
But soon the Argus will fall asleep
Trusting the treacherous locks
And I am in your abode
By my swift steps
By voluptuous silence
By bold trembling hands
For inflamed breath
And to hot gentle lips
Find out the lover has arrived
My delights of joy
Oh Lida if only they were dying
With the bliss of bliss and love
I meet the eighteenth spring
This may be the last time I'm with you
Thoughtfully listening to the noise of the oak grove
I walk hand in hand over the lake
Where are you recent years of carelessness
With hopes in the bloom of youth
My dear friend we are entering a new world
But there the destiny assigned to us is not equal to ours
And our different ways will leave a mark in life
By the capricious hand of Fortune
The path is shown both happy and glorious
My path is sad and dark
And gentle beauty is given to you
And I like the brilliant gift of nature
And a quick mind and a loyal sweet disposition
You were created for sweet freedom
For joy for glory for fun
They have come your golden years
The fire of love is a lovely time
Hurry to love and happy yesterday
Today again be happy carefully
Cupid commands and tomorrow if possible
Crown the beauty with myrtles again
How many tears I foresee you are the culprit
A cheating friend and a fickle lover
Be faithful to everyone be captivated and captivate
And my lot is in a cloudy fog
Why should I hide the future
Alas I cannot live forever by deception
And forgetting to embrace the shadow of happiness
My whole life is a sad darkness of bad weather
A baby can be two or three springs
I was happy without understanding happiness
They passed but can they be forgotten
They passed by with sorrowful eyes
Looking at the path left forever
On a short path strewn with flowers
Which I spent so much fun through
I shed tears I waste my life in vain
With a painful desire for grief
Your dawn is the dawn of beautiful spring
My my friend autumn dawn
I knew love but I didn't know hope
Suffered alone in silence loved
A mad dream left the languid eyelids
But I haven't forgotten my dark dreams
The soul is filled with an involuntary sad thought
It seems to me that at the feast of life
I will appear alone with melancholy a gloomy guest
I'll show up for an hour and die alone
And the unforgettable friend of the heart will not come
At the last moment my languid gaze will close
And he will not come to the lonely hill
Take a last breath with love
Will my youth pass in the desert
Or am I alien to happy love
Will I die without knowing what joy is
Why was life given to me by the gods
What should I expect A forgotten warrior in the ranks
A lost singer among the crowd
What rewards do I deserve in the future
And what a crown of happiness I will take
But what am I ashamed of No murmur humiliation
There is no righteous god's definition
Is it only me who will not know clear days
No even in tears there is hidden pleasure
And in this life I will have consolation
My humble gift and the happiness of friends
Love will pass desires will die
The cold light will separate us
Who will remember the secret dates
Dreams of delights of past years
Let me remember in the sheets
Leave them a minute trace
My friend I am an infamous poet
Even though he is an Orthodox Christian
The soul is immortal there is no word for it
My poems have an unequal fate
And the songs of the wayward Muse
Fun of the wild youth
They will die a funny death
And the light here will not touch us
Ah my good genius knows
What would I rather do
To the immortality of my soul
Immortality of your creations
We have no control over our destiny
At least there is no doubt
This is the fruit of careless inspiration
Without a signature in your hands
On the modest sheets of friendship
Will escape from general oblivion
But let the labor be in vain
Enlivened by your friendship
Let my poems die
The voice of the heart feelings are unchangeable
They will probably outlive them
The years of confinement have flown by
Peaceful friends for a short time
We see the shelter of solitude
And the Tsarskoye Selo fields
Separation awaits us at the threshold
The distant light's noise calls us
And everyone looks at the road
With the excitement of proud youthful thoughts
Another hid his mind under his shako
Already in warlike attire
He waved his hussar's sabre
In the cool of the Epiphany morning
It freezes beautifully at the parade
And he goes to the guard post to warm up
Another born to be a nobleman
Not honor but love for honors
In the hallway of a noble rogue
He sees himself as a submissive rogue
Only I am obedient to fate in everything
Happy laziness's faithful son
Carefree and indifferent in soul
I dozed off quietly alone
Lancer clerks are equal to me
Equal Laws of the Shako
I'm not rushing to become a captain
And I don’t crawl into the assessor
Friends a little indulgence
Leave me the red cap
While he is for his sins
I wouldn't trade it for a bump
While it's still possible for the lazy
Without fear of terrible disasters
Still with a careless hand
In July open your vest
Having looked at this secret leaflet someday
Once written by me
Fly away to the lyceum corner for a while
With an all-powerful sweet dream
Remember the quick minutes of the first days
Six years of peaceful bondage of union
Sorrows joys dreams of your soul
The quarrels of friendship and the sweetness of reconciliation
What was and will not be again
And with quiet tears of longing
Remember your first love
My friend she passed but with the first friends
Your union was not concluded by a playful dream
Before the terrible times before the terrible destinies
Oh dear he is eternal
For the last time in the silence of solitude
Our Penate listens to my poems
Dear brother of Lyceum life
Sharing my last moments with you
So they passed the years of union
So our brotherly faithful circle is broken
Forgive me kept secret by heaven
Don't be separated my dear friend
With fortune friendship and Phoebus
Find out the love unknown to me
Love hopes delights raptures
And your days are like the flight of dreams
Let them fly by in happy silence
Forgive me wherever I am in the fire of mortal battle
On the peaceful banks of the native stream
I am faithful to the Holy Brotherhood
And may Destiny hear my prayers
May all your friends be happy
Recently seduced by a lovely dream
I saw myself in a shining crown as a king
I dreamed I loved you
And the heart beat with pleasure
I expressed my passion at your feet in raptures
Dreams ah why didn't you prolong happiness
But the gods have not deprived me of everything now
I only lost the kingdom
Are you sad Admit what's wrong with you
I love you my friend But who captivated you
She Who is Glycera or Chloe Lila
Oh no Who are you sacrificing your soul to
Oh my dear you are modest my dear friend
But why are you so upset
And who is to blame The husband is the father of course
Not my friend But what am I to her not him
There is a city in Russia called Luga
Petersburg district
It couldn't be worse
Small towns in mind
If only there were no such thing in this world
My Novorzhev
Forgive me faithful oak groves
Forgive the carefree world of fields
And light-winged amusements
The days that flew by so quickly
Forgive Trigorskoye where is joy
I met so many times
That's why I recognized your sweetness
To leave you forever
I take the memory from you
And I leave my heart to you
Maybe a sweet dream
I will return to your fields
I will come under the linden vaults
On the slope of Trigorsk hill
A fan of friendly freedom
Joy of grace and intelligence
Orlov with Istomina in bed
He lay in wretched nakedness
Didn't distinguish himself in a hot case
The Fickle General
Without thinking of offending my dear
Laisa took the microscope
And he says Let me see
What do you do to me my dear
The Metropolitan is a shameless braggart
I sent you my fruits
Wanted to assure us as you can see
That he himself is the god of his gardens
Perhaps everything is for you Harita
A smile will conquer decrepitude
It will drive the metropolitan crazy
And the ardor of desires will give birth in him
And he met your magical gaze
Forget about his cross
And tenderly will begin to sing prayers
To your heavenly beauty
Listen I'll start a story for you
About Igor and his wife
About Novgorod and the Golden Kingdom
Or maybe about the Terrible Tsar
And grandma started an empty idea
Finish off Ilya the hero for us
Turgenev is a loyal patron
Popov Jews and Skoptsy
But the persecutor is too happy
And Jesuits and fools
And my fruitless laziness
Always carefree and free
Friends of Beneficial Dreams
Why laugh at me
When I have a weak hand
I wander on the lyre in trepidation
And only soft sounds
The torment of this dear love to the heart
In the silent strings I find
With my soul surrendered to pleasure
I fell into a sweet sweet slumber
Only you with deep laziness
He combined hunting with work
You alone are a passionate lover
And Solomirskaya and the cross
Then at night you jump with a beautiful woman
Then you preach Christ
At weddings and in the Bible Hall
Among the joys and worries
You drop Lunina at the ball
You will raise the trembling orphans
Sloth cute on Parnassus
Forgetting the sorrow of his love
Dozing with a smile in Arzamas
And you sleep at Count de Laval's
Bearing a painful burden
Empty or heavy duties
You are the only one who finds time
Laugh at my laziness
Don't call me anymore
To the works abandoned forever
Not to poetic captivity
Not to processed poems
What is needed if there is an error
And sometimes I sing weakly
Let Nineta just smile
My carefree love
It will inflame and calm
But work is cold and empty
A poem is never worth it
Smiles of voluptuous lips
Don't ask why with a sad thought
In the midst of fun I am often overshadowed
Why do I raise my sullen gaze to everything
Why is the dream of sweet life not dear to me
Don't ask why with a cold soul
I fell out of love with cheerful love
And I don't call anyone cute
He who has loved once will never love again
Those who knew happiness will never know happiness
For a brief moment bliss is given to us
From youth from bliss and lust
Only despondency will remain
An inexperienced lover of foreign lands
And his own constant accuser
I spoke in my homeland
Where is the true mind where is the genius we will find
Where is the citizen with a noble soul
Sublime and ardently free
Where is the woman not with cold beauty
But with a fiery captivating life
Where can I find a casual conversation
Brilliant cheerful enlightened
With whom can you be neither cold nor empty
I almost hated my homeland
But I saw Gallitsyna yesterday
And reconciled with my fatherland
In sad idleness I forgot the lyre
Imagination did not flare up in dreams
With the gifts of youth my genius flew away
And the heart slowly grew cold and closed
I called you again on the days of my spring
You flew under the canopy of silence
Days of friendship love hope and tender sadness
When the poetry lover is serene
On the happy lyre I quietly sang
The excitement of love the sadness of separation
And the rumble of the oak groves transmitted to the mountains
My pensive sounds
In vain did I drag the burden of shameful laziness
I involuntarily fell into a cold slumber
I ran from joy I ran from the dear muses
And with tears in his eyes he said goodbye to glory
But suddenly like a lightning bolt
Youth was kindled in a withered heart
The soul woke up and came to life
I learned again the hope sorrow and joy of love
Everything blossomed again I was trembling with life
Nature's enthusiastic witness again
I felt more alive I breathed more freely
Virtue captivated me more strongly
Praise be to love praise be to the gods
Once again the sweet lyre's youthful voice rang out
And with a ringing tremor the resurrected strings
I carry it to your feet
Run and hide from sight
Cythera the Weak Queen
Where are you where are you thunderstorm of kings
Freedom proud singer
Come and pluck the wreath from me
Break the effeminate lyre
I want to sing Freedom to the world
To strike vice on thrones
Reveal to me the noble trail
That exalted Gaul
To whom itself among glorious troubles
You inspired bold hymns
Pets of the Windy Fate
Tremble tyrants of the world
And you be of good courage and listen
Rise up fallen slaves
Alas wherever I look
Everywhere there are whips everywhere there are glands
The fatal shame of laws
The feeble tears of captivity
Everywhere there is unjust power
In the thickened darkness of prejudice
The terrible Genius of Slavery sat down
And the fatal passion of Glory
Only there above the king's head
The suffering of the peoples did not lie
Where is strong with holy Liberty
A combination of powerful laws
Where their firm shield is spread out to all
Where squeezed by faithful hands
Citizens above equal heads
Their sword slides without choice
And crime from above
Strikes with righteous force
Where their hand cannot be bribed
Neither by greedy stinginess nor by fear
The crown and throne of the Lord are yours
It is the Law that gives not nature
You stand above the people
But the eternal Law is above you
And woe to the tribes
Where he sleeps carelessly
Where either the people or the kings
It is possible to rule by law
I call you as a witness
O martyr of glorious errors
For the ancestors in the noise of recent storms
He who laid down the king's head
Ludwig rises to his death
In view of the silent offspring
The head of the dethroned was pressed
To the bloody scaffold of Treachery
The Law is silent the people are silent
The criminal axe will fall
And behold the villainous purple
On the chained Gauls lies
Autocratic Villain
I hate you and your throne
Your destruction is the death of children
I see with cruel joy
They read on your forehead
Seal of the curse of the people
You are the horror of the world the shame of nature
You are a reproach to God on earth
When on the gloomy Neva
The midnight star is shining
And a carefree chapter
A good night's sleep is a burden
The pensive singer looks on
On the menacingly sleeping in the fog
Deserted monument of the tyrant
A palace abandoned to oblivion
And Klii hears a terrible voice
Behind these terrible walls
Caligulla's last hour
He sees vividly before his eyes
He sees in ribbons and stars
Drunk with wine and anger
The secret killers are coming
There is insolence on their faces fear in their hearts
The unfaithful sentry is silent
The drawbridge is silently lowered
The gates are open in the darkness of the night
By the hand of mercenary betrayal
O shame oh horror of our days
How the beasts invaded the Janissaries
The inglorious blows will fall
The crowned villain has died
And today learn about the kings
No punishment no reward
No shelter no dungeons no altars
Fences that are not true for you
Bow your heads first
Under the reliable canopy of the Law
And they will become the eternal guard of the throne
Freedom and peace of nations
Don't threaten a young sloth
I don't expect an untimely death
In a wreath of love for the coffin shelter
Without thinking about anything without timid tears I go
I lived little I enjoyed little
But sometimes he picked flowers of joy
I have only seen the beginning of life
Don't scare us dear friend
Coffin near housewarming
We have no right to such idleness
There is no time to do anything
Let the cup of life cool down
Another one pulls slowly
We will lose our youth
Along with dear life
Each at his own tomb
We'll sit on the threshold
At the Paphos queen's
Let's ask for a fresh wreath
An extra moment for faithful laziness
Circular pour vessel
And our shadows in a crowd
They will run away to the quiet Summer
Our mortal moment will be bright
And the naughty girlfriends
They will gather their light ashes
Into the urns of idle feasts
Licinius do you see on a fast chariot
Crowned with laurels in a shining purple robe
Young Vetuliy lounging proudly
It flies along the pavement into the crowd of people
Look how everyone humbly bows their backs before him
Look how the lictors drive the unfortunate people
A long line of flatterers senators beauties
A zealous gaze follows him with tenderness
They wait and catch with trepidation the smiles of the eyes' movements
As if by the wondrous blessing of the gods
And little children and old men with gray hair
Everyone fell silently into the dust before the idol
For them even the trace of wheels is imprinted in the mud
There is a certain monument honorable and sacred
O Romulan people tell me how long ago you fell
Who enslaved you and shackled you with power
The proud Quirites bowed under the yoke
To whom oh heavens to whom were they enslaved
Shall I tell Vetulia to my Fatherland the shame of my
A dissolute youth sat in the council of men
The despot's favorite rules the weak senate
He stretched a yoke over Rome dishonoring his fatherland
Vetulius the Roman king O shame o times
Or is the universe doomed to destruction
But who is under the portico with his head bowed
In a tattered cloak with a walking stick
A frowning man walks through the noisy crowd
Where are you our sage friend of truth Damet
Where I don’t know I’ve been silent for a long time and I see
I will leave Rome forever I hate slavery
Licinius good friend Is it not better for us too
Humbly bowing to Fortune and dreams
Learn from the example of the gray-haired cynic
Wouldn't it be better for us to say goodbye to this depraved city
Where is everything corrupt laws right
And consul and tribune and honor and beauty
Let Glyceria be a young beauty
Equal to all common as a circular cup
The inexperience of others in hiring catches the net
We are ashamed to have weaknesses and wrinkles
Let us leave the glitter of joy to vain youth
Let the shameless Cleitus be the servant of the nobles Cornelius
They trade in meanness and with an insolent brow
From the noble to the rich they crawl from house to house
I am a Roman at heart freedom boils in my chest
The spirit of a great nation does not sleep within me
Licinius let's hurry away from worries
Mad sages of deceptive beauties
Having despised the blows of envious fate in my soul
We will bring our father's chests to the village
In the coolness of ancient groves on the seashore
It is not difficult for us to find a secluded bright house
Where there is no longer any fear of popular unrest
In old age we will rest in the wilderness of solitude
And there settling down in a cozy corner
With a fiery oak burning in the fireplace
Remembering the old days behind my grandfather's vial
I will inflame my spirit with cruel Juvenal
I will depict vice in righteous satire
And I will reveal the morals of these centuries to posterity
O Rome o proud land of depravity and villainy
A terrible day will come the day of vengeance and punishment
I foresee the end of the terrible greatness
The crown of the universe will fall into the dust
The young nations are sons of fierce warfare
With swords they will raise their mighty hands against you
And the mountains and seas will be left behind
And they will rush at you like a boiling river
Rome will disappear and be covered in deep darkness
And the traveler fixing his eye on the piles of stones
Will exclaim in gloomy thought deepened
Rome grew by freedom and was destroyed by slavery
I'm not that passionate lover
Whom did the world marvel at before
My spring and summer are red
For a century gone and no trace
Cupid god of the young age
I was your faithful servant
Oh if only I could be born again
Would I serve you like that
Where is our rose
My friends
The rose has withered
Child of the Dawn
Don't say
This is how youth fades
Don't say
This is the joy of life
Tell the flower
I'm sorry I regret it
And on the lily
Show us
All in mysterious silence
The hill was dressed in darkness
Walks in the cloudy glow
Young crescent moon
I see a lyre over a grave
Dozing in sweet silence
Only sometimes a sad ringing
As if the voice of laziness is sweet
In the dead one a string is heard
I see a turtle dove on the lyre
In roses cup and crown
The other will rest here in peace
The sage of lust
Look at the porphyry
His incisor brought him to life
Here he is looking in the mirror
Saying I'm gray and old
Let me enjoy life
Life alas is not an eternal gift
Here raising his palms on the lyre
And frowning importantly
He wants to sing of the god of war
But he sings of one love
Here nature is preparing
Pay the last debt
The old man dances in a round dance
Asks to quench his thirst
Around the gray lover
The maidens jump and sing
He is in a stingy time
Steals a few minutes
Here are the Muses and the Charites
The favorite was taken away to the coffin
Entwined with ivy roses
The games followed suit
He disappeared like a delight
Like a merry dream of love
Your mortal age is a ghost
Catch the fast happiness
Enjoy enjoy
Fill the cup more often
Be tired of ardent passion
And rest over the cup
Have you heard the voice of the night beyond the grove
Singer of love singer of his sorrow
When the fields were silent in the morning hour
The sound of the flute is sad and simple
Have you heard
Have you ever met in the deserted darkness of the forest
Singer of love singer of his sorrow
Did you notice traces of tears or a smile
Or a quiet gaze filled with longing
Have you met
Did you sigh listening to the quiet voice
Singer of love singer of his sorrow
When did you see a young man in the woods
Meeting the gaze of his dull eyes
Did you sigh
Morpheus give me joy until the morning
My painful love
Come blow out my lamp
Bless my dreams
Hide from sad memory
Separation is a terrible sentence
Let me see your sweet gaze
Let me hear your sweet voice
When will the darkness of the night pass away
And you will leave my eyes
Oh if only the soul could
Forget love until the next night
The gods have given you more
Golden days golden nights
And the languid maidens are directed
Watchful eyes are on you
Play sing oh friends
Lose the fleeting evening
And your carefree joy
I will smile through my tears
Today are good husbands
I will amuse you with a new fairy tale
Did you know my friends
A blind boy with a bandage
Blind man have mercy on Phoebus
Cupid is not blind at all my friends
But the naughty boy had a desire
To make people laugh and to spite them
His madness led
Madness leads Eros
But suddenly I don't know why
It bored him
I took on a new venture
Taking off the blindfold from the dear eyes
The prankster goes to Hymen
And what is Hymen
He is the silent son of Vulcan
Cold decrepit and lazy
Grumbling and dozing for a whole century
But he is a good man by the way
Yes he has a jealous nature
God is sad from jealousy
I couldn't get a good night's sleep
I was still afraid of my little brother
I was spying on him secretly
And he kept watch over his adversary
With his annoying lantern
Here my boy comes up to him
And he starts a treacherous speech
Rejoice Hymen
Well let's make peace be smarter
Forget it my dear comrade
Discord is ridiculous and useless
Yes just watch forever
Take this bandage as a keepsake my dear
And give me your lantern
And what did the sad god believe
Cupid jumped for joy
And with all his might he looked at his eyes
I've tightened the reins for my brother
Hymena boring patrols
Since then we have crossed paths at night
His envious glances
Now we are not afraid of beauty
He is calm but his brother is treacherous
Joking about honor and about him
The war is being waged by the ungrateful
With his blind ally
Only sleep falls upon mortals
Cupid in the silence of the night
The lantern is handed over to the lover
And he himself sees off the lucky man
To the sleeping husband's house
Himself from the careless Hymen
He guards the secret door
Understand me my friend Elena
And believe the wise tale
The naughty one crowned by Erata and Venus
Are you luring a prisoner into your domain
In a peaceful estate between Pindus and Cythera
Where Tibullus Melecki and Parni were basking
You are Apollo's spoiled pet
With their lyre to agree the playful flute
The joyful frisky and the nymphs of Helicon
Your happy cradle was rocked
Love your friends with an open soul
In silence feel captivated by beauty
This is my lot I am ready to follow it
But my dear have mercy on me
Don't ask me for poetry
You can't bask in pleasant dazzle forever
I see the light of the tiresome truth too late
In the kindness of my soul I believed in rapture
You are a poet to the dream that whispered
And disregarding wise threats and advice
With careless laziness he strung together couplets
He amused himself with an innocent toy
Bacchus's lover I am sober among friends
Sometimes he sang wine in water verses
Dreamy Dorid both praised and scolded
Or he wove a wreath for friendship and friendship yawned
And sleepy poems were recited in the drowsiness
But how long did Apollo cherish me
The soul is bored with Parnassian amusements
I did not dream for long of the dreams of muses and glory
And by strict experience involuntarily awakened
Having fallen asleep among the roses on the thorns I woke up
I saw that there is no genius seal yet
The mortal hunt for rhymes to babble
Comparing your poems with mine made me smile
And I have enough writing
Dreams dreams
Where is your sweetness
Where are you where are you
Night joy
He disappeared
A happy dream
And lonely
In deep darkness
I am awakened
Around the bed
Silent Night
They instantly cooled down
They flew away in an instant
Away in a crowd
Dreams of love
Still full
Soul of Desire
And catches sleep
Memories
Love love
Hear the prayer
Send me again
My visions
And in the morning
Intoxicated again
Let me die
Unawakened
What's new By God nothing new
Hey don't be cunning you probably know something
Aren't you ashamed of your friend
How do you always hide everything from the enemy
Or are you angry have mercy brother for what
Don't be stubborn tell me at least a word
Oh get off me that's all I know
What are you a fool This is nothing new
Forget it my dear Kaverin
The immodest verses of momentary playfulness
I love you first be sure
Your happy sins
Everything goes in a certain order
Everything has its time everything has its moment
A funny and flighty old man
A funny and sedate young man
While we live live
Walk into my memory
Pray to both Bacchus and love
And despise the rabble's jealous murmuring
She doesn't know that it's possible to live in harmony
With Cythera with a portico and with a book and with a glass
That a high mind can be hidden
Crazy pranks under a light blanket
Love friendship and laziness
Sheltered from worries and troubles
Live under their safe shadow
In solitude you are happy you are a poet
The confidant of the gods is not afraid of evil storms
Above him their providence is high and holy
He is rocked by young stones
And with a finger on their lips they guard his peace
O dear friend and to me the goddess of song
Even in the infant breast
Influenced by the spark of inspiration
And they showed the secret way
I am the delight of lyrical sounds
As a baby I knew how to feel
And the lyre became my destiny
But where are you moments of rapture
The inexplicable heat of the heart
Spirited work and tears of inspiration
As the smoke disappeared my light gift
How early I attracted the bloody gaze of envy
And the invisible dagger of malicious slander
No no neither happiness nor glory
Nor a proud thirst for praise
I will not be carried away in happy inaction
I will forget my dear muses my tormentors
But maybe I'll sigh in silent delight
Listening to the sound of your strings
What is more delightful than alive
Wars of battles and fires
Bloody and empty fields
Bivouac of knightly blows
And what is more enviable than short days
Not too wise mustachioed ones
But with the heart of true hussars
They live in their tents
Far away from fun and pleasures and graces
How the Immortal Coward Horace Lived
In the dark forests of Tibur
They don't know the light of compulsion
They don't know that boredom is fear
They give dinners and battles
They sing and fight
Happy is he who is dear and terrible to the world
About whom for songs for deeds
True praise thunders
Who glorified Mars and Temir
And he hung up the warlike lyre
Between the faithful saber and the saddle
For the last time in the shadow of solitude
Our penate listens to my poems
Dear brother of Lyceum life
Sharing my last moments with you
The summers of union have passed
He has broken our faithful circle
Forgive me Protected by Heaven
Don't be separated my dear friend
With freedom and Phoebus
Find out the love unknown to me
Love hopes delights raptures
And your days are like the flight of dreams
Let them fly by in happy silence
Forgive me Wherever I may be in the fire of mortal battle
On the peaceful banks of the native stream
I am faithful to the Holy Brotherhood
And may fate hear my prayers
May all your friends be happy
Where does the wonderful noise and frantic cries come from
Who is called where and tambourines and timbrel
What do the joyful faces mean
And the songs of the villagers
There is bright freedom in their circle
Received a festive wreath
But crowds of people moved
He is approaching Here he is here is a strong god
Here is Bacchus peaceful and eternally young
Here he is the hero of India
O joy full of you
The strings are trembling and ready to strike
Not with hypocritical praise
Evan evoy Give me the cups
Bring fresh crowns
Slaves where are our thyrsi
Let's run to a peaceful battle brave fighters
Here he is Bacchus O joyful hour
The sovereign thyrsus in his hands
The grape crown turns yellow
In black curly hair
His young tigers flow
With submissive fury they drag
The erotic games are flying all around
And they sing hymns in his honor
A goat-legged one is crowding behind him
And a swarm of fauns and satyrs
Their horns are entangled in ivy
They run in a confused crowd
Following the swift chariot
Who with a reed pipe
Who with his faithful mug
He stumbles and falls
And the velvet carpet of fields
It pours crimson wine
With wild laughter from friends
There in the distance I see a wonderful move
The cheerful timbrels sound
Young nymphs and sylvans
Forming a noisy round dance
They carry the motionless Silenus
The wine flows and foam splashes
And roses are pouring out all around
They carry a sleeping old man
And the thyrsus is a symbol of peaceful victory
And the cup is heavy and golden
Crowned with a sapphire lid
The Gift of Bacchus is Expensive
But the distant shore howls
Hair spread over shoulders
Crowned with a bunch of naked
Bacchantes run through the mountains
The timbrels ring out between their fingers
They thunder and echo their terrible voices
They rushed they flew they twisted their arms
They trample the meadow with a magical dance
And ardent youth in crowds
Flows around
The frantic maidens sing
Their voluptuous melodies
The heat of love is poured into hearts
Their peaches breathe with lust
Their eyes are full of madness and languor
They said catch your happiness
Their inspired movements
First they show us
The shyness of sweet confusion
The desire is timid and there
Delight and audacity of pleasure
But now they have scattered across the hills and fields
They rush with their thyrsi waving
Their cries can already be heard from afar
And the hum echoes through the forests
Evan evoy Give me the cups
Bring fresh crowns
Slaves where are our thyrsi
Let's run to a peaceful battle brave fighters
Friends on this blessed day
Let us cast vanity into oblivion
The wine flows like a foamy stream
In honor of Bacchus the Muses and Beauty
Evan evoy Give me the cups
Bring fresh crowns
Slaves where are our thyrsi
Let's run to a peaceful battle brave fighters
A simple pupil of Nature
That's how I used to sing
The beautiful dream of Freedom
And he breathed sweetly of her
But I see you I listen to you
And what about a weak person
Freedom lost forever
I adore captivity with all my heart
When will you squeeze my hand again
Which gives you
On a boring path and separation
The Holy Bible of the Harith
Cupid found her in Cythera
In the archive of Young Pranks
Pray to your Venus through it
With a pious soul
Forgive me my Epicurean
Remain forever as you are now
Fly to dark Albion
May they protect you in a foreign land
Christ and faithful Cupid
Carry Penate to someone else's border
But remembering his former days
Love your unchaste brother
Sufferer of sensual love
Have I seen you my dear friend
Or maybe it was a wrong dream
A vague dream and a fiery illness
Deception excited my imagination
In the dark moments of fatal illness
Were you the gentle maiden who stood above me
In warrior's clothes with pleasant awkwardness
So I saw you my dim gaze recognized you
Familiar beauties under this military clothing
And in a weak whisper I called my friend
But again dark dreams crowded my mind
I searched for you in the darkness with a weak hand
And suddenly I feel your breath tears
And a wet kiss on a fiery forehead
Immortals with what excitement
The fire of life's desires ran through my heart
I began to boil and tremble
And you disappeared like a lovely ghost
Cruel friend you torment me with rapture
Come love is killing me
In the silence of the gracious night
Come sorceress let me see you again
Under your menacing shako your heavenly eyes
And a cloak and a combat belt
And feet adorned with military footwear
Don't delay hurry my lovely warrior
Come I'm waiting for you Good health is a gift
The gods have sent me down again
And with it sweet worries
Mysterious love and youthful mischief
When to the dreamy world
Striving with an elevated soul
You hold a lyre on your lap
With an impatient hand
When visions change
Before you in the magical darkness
And the quick cold of inspiration
The hair rises on the forehead
You are right you create for a few
Not for envious judges
Not for the poor collectors
Other people's opinions and news
But for friends of strict talent
Sacred truth of friends
Not everyone will love happiness
Not all were born for crowns
Blessed is he who knows lust
High thoughts and poems
Who enjoys the beautiful
He received a wonderful destiny
And your delight was understood
With fiery and clear delight
The Zoilus crushed by an immortal hand
You don't deserve the stigma of shame again
Does your dishonor need a change
Our Tacitus will want to look at you
Calm down and be happy with your previous verse
A puny crawler from the depths of Defontaine
Mighty god of gardens I fall before you
You are a friend to whom everything in nature is sacrificed
I placed your ugly face with a prayer
In my humble garden
Not so that you remove wayward goats
And birds from fruits both tender and unripe
I adorned you with a wreath of wild roses
When the villagers danced happily
Oak groves where in the silence of freedom
Oak groves where in the silence of freedom
I greeted every day with happiness
I step under your vaults again
Under your friendly shadow
And joy was resurrected for me
And the soul was stirred again
My lost youth
The painful sweetness of longing
And the hearts first love
The Solitary Lover of the Muses
In the shade of captivating oak groves
I was a touched witness
Her infantile amusements
She blossomed before me
And I am of wonderful beauty
I already guessed with a dream
Still unclear features
And the thought of her inspired me
The first sound of my pipe
And taught the heart a secret
You find pleasure in sorrowful passion
You enjoy shedding tears
To torment the imagination with a vain flame
And to hide a quiet despondency in the heart
Believe me you don’t love you inexperienced dreamer
Oh if only you were a seeker of sad feelings
A terrible madness of love befell
If only all her poison boiled in your blood
Whenever in the long hours of a sleepless night
On the bed slowly tormented by melancholy
You called for deceptive peace
In vain closing my mournful eyes
The hot covers were embraced while sobbing
And dried up in the fury of fruitless desire
Believe me then you wouldn't have fed
Ungrateful dreaming
No no falling at my feet in tears
His haughty mistress
Trembling pale frenzied
Then you would cry out to the gods
Give me back my clouded mind gods
Take from me this image of the fatal
I have loved enough give me peace
But a dark love and an unforgettable image
We would stay with you forever
On the modest noble lyre
I did not praise the earthly gods
And strength in free pride
I didn't burn the censer of flattery
Freedom is only learned to be glorified
Sacrificing poetry only to her
I was not born to amuse kings
My bashful Muse
But I confess under Helikon
Where the Castalian current made noise
I am inspired by Apollo
Elizabeth sang in secret
The earthly witness of heaven
With an inflamed soul
I sang virtue on the throne
With her welcoming beauty
Love and Secret Freedom
They inspired the heart with a simple hymn
And my incorruptible voice
There was an echo of the Russian people
And I heard that God's light
Beautiful only in friendship
That without her there is no joy
That the path of life would be terrible for us
If it weren't for the light of quiet friendship
But listen there is another feeling
It both pampers and languishes
In work worries and in peace
Always awake and burning
It is excruciatingly cruel
It kills our entire soul
If the ulcer is severe and deep
The oil of hope does not bring life
This is the passion that I burn with
I am withering and dying in the prime of life
But I don’t want to be healed
How sweet but gods how dangerous
I listen to you and see your sweet gaze
Will I forget the smile the beautiful look
And a fiery magical conversation
Sorceress why did I see you
Having known you I have come to know bliss
And he hated my happiness
Hurray is jumping to Russia
The Nomadic Despot
The Savior cries bitterly
All the people follow him
Mary in her troubles frightens the Savior
Don't cry child don't cry sir
Here is the beech beech of the Russian king
The king enters and speaks
Get to know the people of Russia
What the whole world knows
Both Prussian and Austrian
I sewed myself a uniform
O people rejoice I am well-fed healthy and plump
The newspaperman praised me
I drank and ate and promised
And I’m not tormented by the matter
Listen in addition
What will I do next
I will let Lavrov resign
And Soca to the yellow house
I will establish the law in your place Gorgoli
And I give people the rights of people
By my royal grace
I will give it out of good will
In bed with joy
The child burst into tears
Is that really true
Is this really serious
And his mother said Bye-bye close your eyes
It's finally time to sleep
Well listen as the king-father
Tells fairy tales
Why this immodest attire
With a sweet voice and gaze
To kindle a young heart
And with a quiet sweet reproach
To call for an easy victory
Why deceptive tenderness
The feigned appearance of modesty
The languid carelessness of movements
And the trembling of the lips and the heat of the cheeks
All your cunning efforts are in vain
There is no life in a vicious heart
An involuntary chill of indignation
My fatal answer to you
With your arrogant charm
Who did not own in the darkness of the night
Tell the door to the appreciated one
Your despised abode
Who has not knocked with a bold hand
No no to another his wilted one
Bring a wreath beauty
Caress the inexperienced vice
Tired in your arms
But forget the proud plan
You won't attract the muse's pet
You on the treacherous breast
Bring the bonds of hire to others
The shameful bargaining of your love
Cold kisses of self-interest
And forced desires
And delight bought with gold
Love hope quiet glory
Deception did not pamper us for long
The youthful amusements have disappeared
Like a dream like morning fog
But there is still a burning desire within us
Under the yoke of fatal power
With an impatient soul
We heed the call of the Fatherland
We wait with yearning hope
Minutes of saintly freedom
How a young lover awaits
Minutes of a faithful date
While we are burning with freedom
While hearts are alive for honor
My friend let's dedicate it to the fatherland
The soul's beautiful impulses
Comrade believe me she will rise
The star of captivating happiness
Russia will awaken from its sleep
And on the ruins of autocracy
They will write our names
Laisa I love your bold free look
Unquenchable heat open desires
And continuous kisses
And the conversation is full of passion
I love the burning lips I call silently
Delights are fast and alive
Intoxicated by memories
With reverence and longing
I embrace your formidable marble
Kagul monument arrogant
Not a brave feat of Russians
Not glory is the gift of Catherine
Not a Transdanubian Giant
I am inflamed now
A fun evening in our life
Let's remember young friends
Champagne in a glass bowl
The cold stream hissed
We drank and Venus was with us
The girl sat at the table
When will we sit down again as a foursome
With wine and chubuks
Olga Cyprida's goddaughter
Olga is a miracle of beauty
What about affection and insults
You are used to squandering
Let's kiss the sweet ones
You disturb our hearts
Seductive happiness
You set a secret hour
We are in the heat of love
We'll arrive at the appointed hour
We knock on the door but for the hundredth time
We hear your insidious whisper
And the maids' sleepy murmur
And a mocking refusal
For the sake of wild debauchery
Priapic ploys
For the sake of bliss for the sake of gold
For the sake of your charm
Olga is a priestess of pleasure
Hear our loving cry
Night of delights night of oblivion
We should probably appoint
Mansurov is a bosom friend
Put on the crown of thorns
Take a breath and drink a glass suddenly
For the health of Krylova
Believe me she is faithful to you
Like the Virgin Lassie
She submits to fate
And to Mrs Casassi
But soon by a lucky hand
The school's heel will be thrown off
It will lie down on velvet before you
AND
Let my soul open up to you
And in sweet friendship to draw joy
Bored with life tormented by vanity
I long to rest near you my gentle friend
Do you remember my dear the dawn of our years
We knew how to love babies
How quickly they flew away
 
Among strangers in a bad land
I lived little and enjoyed little
And the sad beginning of my days
I've been bored and disgusted for a long time
What is life to me I was not born for happiness
For joys for friendship for fun avoiding
I drank coldly from the cup of lust
I also like golden curls in Doris
And a pale face and blue eyes
Yesterday my friends left the night feast
In her arms I drank bliss with my soul
Quick delights were replaced by delights
Desires suddenly faded and flared up again
I melted but among the uncertain darkness
I saw other sweet features
And I was filled with a mysterious sadness
And my lips whispered a foreign name
I eluded Aesculapius
Thin shaved but alive
His tormenting paw
Doesn't weigh on me
Health of the lungs is Priapus' friend
And sleep and sweet peace
As before we visited again
My corner is cramped and simple
You too can comfort the half-sick man
He is eager to see you
With you is a happy outlaw
Lazy Pinda citizen
Freedom Bacchus's faithful son
Venus' Devout Worshipper
And the master of pleasures
From the bustle of the idle capital
From the cold charms of the Neva
From the harmful gossip of rumor
From boredom so varied
My name is the hills of the meadows
Shady maples of the garden
The banks of a deserted river
And village freedom
Give me your hand I will come
At the beginning of gloomy September
We will drink with you again
Speaking with an open heart
About the foolish evil nobleman
About the registered serf
About the heavenly king
And sometimes about the earthly
O you who combined
With a passionate and frank soul
Although he is a Russian general
Courtesy is an enlightened mind
Oh you who with each passing day
Rising to the torment of war
On horseback for the tired mustachioed
You teach the kings science
But don't dishonor in the heat of the moment
His warlike hand
With the executioner's despised stick
Orlov you are right I forget
My hussar dreams
And with Solomon I exclaim
Uniform and sabre of vanity
On General Kiselev
I will not give up my hopes
He is very nice and doesn't say a word about it
He is the enemy of deceit and ignorance
Over a noisy slow lunch
I'm glad to sit next to him
I'm glad to listen to him until the night
But he is a courtier of promises
They don't cost him anything
Having subdued unpeaceful desires
Without a dolman without a mustache
I will hide with the secret of freedom
With a trumpet of bliss and nature
Under the shade of grandfather's forests
Above the lake in a quiet hut
Or in the grass of dense meadows
Or a hill on a green slope
In a Bukhara hat and robe
I will sing my gods
And I will wait until he rises
From the bed of rest the god of swords
And a loud challenge to abuse will sound
Then I will leave the world of fields
Bellona's Flaming Pet
The throne has a loyal citizen
Orlov I will stand under the banners
Your warlike squads
In tents amidst the battle amidst the fires
With a sword and a fighting lyre
I will fight in front of you
And sing the glory of your blows
Life is that dear friend
Who is not sick with stupid passion
Who has no time to fall in love
Who is busy with everything and happy with everything
Who's Nadinka in the evening
At the secret dinner he caresses
And the fat Strasbourg pie
Washes it down with fragrant wine
Who has cast away worries
As a faithful son of the Paphos faith
Spends a pious night
With the young nun of Cythera
In the morning he sleeps sweetly
Reading the Disabled Person's Leaflet
The whole day is dedicated to fun
And at night Cypris reigns again
And isn't that how we spend our days
Shcherbinin is a playful friend of fun
With Cupid Prank Wine
While we are young and healthy
But the young days will fly by
Fun and negativity will leave us
Feelings will change your desires
Hearts will dry up and grow cold
Then no songs no girlfriends
Without pleasures without desires
Let's find some solace my dear friend
In a foggy dream of memories
Then shaking his head
I'll tell you at the door of the coffin
Do you remember Fanny my dear
And we'll both smile quietly
Greetings to you deserted corner
A haven of peace labor and inspiration
Where the invisible stream of my days flows
In the bosom of happiness and oblivion
I am yours I have exchanged the wicked court of Circe
Luxurious feasts of fun delusion
To the peaceful noise of oak groves to the silence of fields
On the free idleness of thought
I love yours this dark garden
With its coolness and flowers
This meadow is filled with fragrant haystacks
Where clear streams rustle in the bushes
There are moving pictures everywhere in front of me
Here I see two lakes and azure plains
Where the fisherman's sail sometimes turns white
Behind them there is a row of hills and striped fields
Scattered huts in the distance
On the damp banks there are wandering herds
Smoky barns and winged mills
Everywhere there are traces of contentment and work
I am here freed from the shackles of vanity
I learn to find bliss in Truth
With a free soul to worship the Law
Don't listen to the murmurings of the unenlightened crowd
To respond with compassion to the shy prayer
And don't envy fate
A villain or a fool in unjust greatness
Oracles of the ages here I ask you
In majestic solitude
Your joyful voice is heard more clearly
He drives away the gloomy sleep of laziness
Work gives birth to a passion in me
And your creative thoughts
They mature in the depths of the soul
But a terrible thought darkens the soul here
Among the flowering fields and mountains
A friend of humanity sadly remarks
Everywhere the murderous Shame of Ignorance
Not seeing tears not listening to groans
Chosen by Destiny for the destruction of people
Here the lordship is wild without feeling without law
Appropriated by force of vine
And the labor and property and time of the farmer
Leaning on someone else's plow submitting to the whips
Here Slavery drags itself along the furrows
The Relentless Owner
Here the heavy yoke drags everyone to the grave
I dare not cherish hopes and inclinations in my soul
Here young maidens bloom
For the whim of an unfeeling villain
A sweet support for aging fathers
Young sons comrades of labor
From their native hut they go to multiply themselves
Yard crowds of exhausted slaves
Oh if only my voice could stir hearts
Why does a fruitless heat burn in my chest
And fate has not given me the formidable gift of oratory
Will I see oh friends a people not oppressed
And Slavery fell at the behest of the king
And over the fatherland of enlightened Freedom
Will the beautiful Dawn finally rise
No no your penalties are in vain
I love you still the same me
Days our dear friends
They run like morning shadows
Like the waters of a fast-flowing stream
How long ago by secret destinies
The cup of life is given to us
It is still full for us
Pressing his lips to its edges
We drink delight and love
For us there is hope and pleasure
 
How new are the delusions
We enjoy blooming
But memory seeks to revive
But the heart is in a quiet sleep
He likes to forget himself in the past
The invisible patron of the peaceful estate
I pray to you my good brownie
Protect the village forest and my wild garden
And the humble abode of my family
May the dangerous cold of the rains not harm the fields
And the late autumn winds raid
Yes at the right time the snows are beneficial
They will cover the fields with wet fertilizer
Remain secret guard in the hereditary shadow
Comprehend the timidity of the midnight thief
And from an unfriendly gaze
Happy guard house
Walk around him with a caring guard
Love my little garden and the shore of sleepy waters
And this secluded garden
With a dilapidated gate and a collapsed fence
Love the green slope of the hills
Meadows trampled by my wandering laziness
The coolness of the lindens and the noisy roof of the maples
They are familiar with inspiration
Hello Yuryev birthday boy!
Hello Yuriev Life-Ulan
Today is a hermit for you
Drains a foamy glass
Hello Yuryev birthday boy!
Hello Yuriev Life-Ulan
Great dashing knights
Love Freedom and wine
For us young allies
The lamp of hope is lit
Great dashing knights
Love Freedom and wine
Hello youth and happiness
Table Cup and Brothel
Where there is lust with loud laughter
Leads us drunk to bed
good youth and happiness
Table Cup and Brothel
Above the lake in the dense oak groves
Once upon a time a monk was saved
Always in harsh occupations
In fasting prayer and labor
Already with a humble shovel
The old man dug his own grave
And only about the desired death
I prayed to the holy saints
One summer day on the doorstep
Of his drooping hut
The anchorite prayed to God
The oak groves became blacker
The fog over the lake was steaming
And the red moon in the clouds
Rolled quietly across the sky
The monk began to look at the waters
He looks involuntarily full of fear
He can't understand himself
And he sees the waves boiling
And suddenly they calmed down again
And suddenly light as a night shadow
White as the early snow of the hills
A naked woman comes out
And silently sat down on the banks
Looks at the old Monk
And scratches his wet hair
The Holy Monk trembles with fear
And looks at her beauty
She beckons him with her hand
Nods his head quickly
And suddenly like a shooting star
Hidden under a sleepy wave
The gloomy old man did not sleep all night
And I didn't pray all day
In front of me with an involuntary thought
I saw the shadow of a wonderful maiden
The oak groves were once again clothed in darkness
The moon went across the clouds
And again the maiden above the water
Sits lovely and pale
Looks and nods his head
Kisses from afar jokingly
Plays splashes like a wave
Laughs and cries like a child
Calls the Monk groans tenderly
Monk Monk To me to me
And suddenly it drowns in transparent waves
And all in deep silence
On the third day the passionate hermit
Near the enchanted shores
He sat and waited for the beautiful maiden
And the shadow fell among the oak groves
The dawn drove away the darkness of the night
The monk was not found anywhere
And only a gray beard
The boys saw in the water
Whose thought was guessed with delight
I have mastered the secret of beauty
Whose brush on the sky meant
These heavenly features
You are a genius but love suffers
He was struck down by the mute gaze
He fixed his gaze on his creation
And the fiery soul goes out
Blessed is he who is in the distant shadow
Away from the demanding ignoramuses
Divides days between work and laziness
Memories and hopes
To whom did Fate send friends
Who is hidden by the grace of the Creator
From the fool's sleeper
From the awakener of the impudent
I love an evening feast
Where is Fun Chairman
And Freedom is my idol
At the table is the legislator
Where to drink the word until the morning
Drowns out the cries of songs
Where the circle of guests is spacious
And the circle of bottles is small
Forgive me happy son of feasts
Spoiled Child of Freedom
So from our shores
From the dead area of slaves
Corporals of whims and fashion
You are riding to peaceful Moscow
Where pleasures are valued
They sleep carelessly in reality
And in life they love change
Diverse and lively
Moscow captivates with its diversity
Feasts of ancient luxury
Brides with bells
With a funny light bustle
Innocent prose and poetry
You're there at noisy parties
You will see important Idleness
Affection in fine lace
And Stupidity in gold glasses
And the joy of heavy Nobility
And Skuku with cards in his hands
Just a minute observer
You will laugh under your hand
But soon the faithful admirer
Fun and golden laziness
Taking my advice
And loving freedom with all my soul
You will leave the circle of great light
And you will decide to live for yourself
Already in a remote shelter
I see you in my mind
Boils in a foamy glass
Ai cold stream
In the thick smoke of lazy pipes
New friends in dressing gowns
They make noise and drink from a cheerful cup
A crazy circle goes around them
And Leisure rushes in joy
And there are Egyptian maidens
They fly and hover before you
I hear ringing chants
A groan of bliss a wild howl of cries
Their frantic movements
Fire of the Furious Eyes
And everything my friend is in your soul
Gives birth to a thrill of rapture
But remember darling there's one here
Waiting for you all the time
The young captive sighs
I'm sad and languid all day
In my sweet thoughtfulness
Quietly cries under the window
Stealthily from the formidable Argus
And looks at the deserted house
Where we feasted so often
With Cyprida Bacchus and you
Where with hope and longing
Her desires flew away
Oh will they soon find their darling
Her downcast gaze
And they will fall before love
The jealous locks of the castles
And our orphaned circle
Comrade will he soon come to life
When will you come galloping my dear friend
My soul strives to follow you
Wherever you are take a wreath
From the hands of young Voluptuousness
And prove that you are an expert
In the unknown science of happiness
There is a forest behind the nearby valley
Where the flow of bright streams is joyful
Young Edwin said goodbye to Alina there
I heard their last kiss
The moon rose Alina sat there
And her chest breathed heavily
The dawn rose Alina kept looking
Through the white steam onto the deserted path
There by the stream under the farewell willow
The shepherd saw her neighbors with spruce trees
When to the stream with a sad bagpipe
In the midday heat he called the herd
About half a year has passed
And I see Edwin walking in the distance
He walked sadly towards the oak grove along the valley
Where the flow of clear waters is joyful
Edwin looks under the willow where he is with his sweetheart
He said goodbye the holy monk stands
A cross was erected over the new grave
And on the cross a crown of withered roses
And suddenly his soul was constrained by fear
Who is hidden here reads the inscription
He fell with his head bowed at the monk's feet
And I heard his last groan
Everything is a ghost of vanity
Everything is crap and nastiness
Glass and beauty
This is the joy of life
Love and Wine
We need equal
Without them a person
I could yawn all my life
I'll add laziness to them
Laziness is with them
I praise love with her
She pours me wine
I know Lidinka is my friend
To whom in sweet thoughtfulness
You dedicated your leisure time
Who are you secretly donating to
From suspicious girlfriends
You are afraid of the little prankster my dear
Light-winged charmer
And with its cold importance
You can't stand Hymen
You pray to another god
Submitting to my Destiny
Tender delights for you
Found a deserted road
I understood the faint glow of the eyes
I understood the half-closed gaze
And the pale cheeks
And the languor of your gait
Your God is not a complete joy
Gives his fans
His mysterious reward
Youthful modesty is precious
He loves the dreams of imagination
He tolerates the lock on the door
He is a bashful friend of pleasure
He is a brother of love but lonely
When insomnia is sad
You languish in the darkness of the night
He revives with a secret power
Your vague dreams
Sighs tenderly with poor Lida
And drives with a quiet hand
And dreams inspired by Cypris
And sweet virginal peace
In solitary enjoyment
You think to deceive love
In vain in the very rapture
You sigh and languish again
Will Cupid not drop by
To your unhallowed shelter
Your beauty is fading like a rose
The minutes of youth are running
Is my prayer in vain
Forget criminal dreams
You won't be beautiful forever
You are not beautiful for yourself
Raevsky is still a young man
And there is already a brave son
And Pushkin is a lazy schoolboy
Parnassian Virgin Goddesses
Zhukovsky came to see you
But to indescribable sadness
The poet was not found at home
And crowned with a cypress
With the French novel Boris
We walked home sadly
What a saint what a bawd
Will bring Zhukovsky to me
Tell me if you'll be there today
With Karamzin with Karamzina
I'm waiting just in case
Be touched by my request
Invites you for a cup of tea
Raevsky is the glory of our days
Early philosopher you run
Feasts and pleasures of life
You look at the games of youth
With cold silence of reproach
You are the sweet amusements of the world
Traded for sadness and boredom
And to the lamp of Epictetus
Golden Horatius Phial
Believe me my friend she will come
It's time for sad regrets
The cold truth of worries
And useless thoughts
Zeus pampering his mortal children
Gives toys to all ages
Don't make noise over gray hairs
Madness frisky rattles
Ah youth never comes again
Call me sweet idleness
And light-winged love
And a light-winged hangover
Drink the pleasure to the last drop
Live carefree and indifferent
Be obedient in every moment of life
Be young in your youth
Everything about Esther captivates us
Enchanting speech
The important step in purple
Black curls to the shoulders
A gentle voice a look of love
Whitened hand
Painted eyebrows
And a huge leg
The barbarian artist with a sleepy brush
The picture of a genius is blackened
And your drawing is illegal
He draws meaninglessly over her
But the colors are alien to the years
Falling off like old scales
The creation of a genius is before us
Comes out with the same beauty
This is how delusions disappear
From my tormented soul
And visions arise in her
Initial clean days
In vain my dear friend did I think to conceal
The cold excitement of a deceived soul
You understand I am in rapture
I stop loving you
The hours of enchantment have disappeared forever
The wonderful time has passed
The youthful desires have faded
Hope in the heart died
Pet mod big world friend
A brilliant observer of customs
You tell me to leave the peaceful circle
Where is the carefree admirer of beauty
I spend my leisure time unknown
How are you my friend in my inexperienced years
Dangerously seduced by vanity
I lost my life feelings and peace
But he was consumed by the fumes of the big world
And I went home to rest
And I confess to you that it is a hundred times dearer to me
Happy family of young rakes
Where the mind is boiling where I am free in my thoughts
Where I argue out loud where I feel more alive
And where are we all beautiful friends
Than sluggish soulless meetings
Where the mind keeps an involuntary silence
Where hearts are struck by cold
Where Buturlin is the legislator of ignoramuses
Where is Sheping the king and boredom the chairman
Where stupidity alone makes everyone equal
I remember their children being proud
Evil without mind without pride arrogant
And having seen the tyrants of fashionable halls
I shun their reproaches and praises
When in the circle of the pious Lais
The drawn-out ignorant general
To the attentive and sleepy beauties
With difficulty he jokes the French madrigal
Looking at everyone with benevolent impudence
And everyone around is dozing and silent
They twirl their moustaches and jingle their spurs
Yes and occasionally they yawn with a smile
Then my friend of forgotten pranksters
Freedom Bacchus and the Muses treat
I don't hear sharp words sometimes
Politicians of funny babble
I don't see worn-out fools
Holy ignoramuses honorable scoundrels
Into the mysticism of courtly antics
And you leave your nobles for a moment
And increase the close circle of my friends
O you are a willful lover
A pleasant flatterer a sarcastic chatterbox
Still a witty uncomplaining person
Still a philosopher and a prankster
One quiet evening recently
I came for a walk in our grove
And there by the river under the oak tree
I saw Natasha sleeping
You know my friends
Sneaking up to Natasha
Kissed twice boldly
Calm down my girl
In my sleep I sighed and blushed
I gave the third kiss too
She didn't want to wake up
Then I couldn't tell her
And then she began to tremble
Lila Lila I'm suffering
With joyless melancholy
I am languishing I am dying
I am extinguishing my fiery soul
But my love is in vain
You're laughing at me
Laugh Lila you are beautiful
And with insensitive beauty
He listens with his accustomed ear
Whistling
He smears with one spirit
Sheet
Then the whole world is tormented
Hearing
Then he prints and into oblivion
Boom
Multiply the noise and joy
Sing songs at good hour
Friendship Grace and Youth
We have birthday girls
Meanwhile the child is winged
Greetings to you friends
Secretly thinks someday
I'll be the birthday boy
The oppressor of all Russia
Governors' tormentor
And he is the teacher of the Council
And he is a friend and brother to the king
Full of malice full of revenge
Without mind without feelings without honor
Who is he Devotee without flattery
The Brigade Soldier
Here is the Tail Patron
This is a serf's soul
The Destroyer of Enlightenment
Patron of Bantysh
Push for God's sake
On him from all sides
Why not try from behind
That's where he's weakest
Let's drink and be merry
Let's play with life
Let the blind mob fuss
It is not for us to imitate the madman
Let our frivolous youth
Drown in bliss and wine
Let the changing joy
He will smile at us even in our sleep
When youth is a light smoke
Will carry away the joys of youthful days
Then we'll take it from old age
All that will be taken away from her
You are rich I am very poor
You are a prose writer I am a poet
You are as red as a poppy flower
I am like death thin and pale
Having no worries in this age
You live in a huge house
I'm in the midst of grief and troubles
I spend my days on the straw
Eat sweets every day
You drag out guilt while free
And you are often lazy
Pay your due debt to nature
I'm from a stale piece
From raw and fresh water
A hundred fathoms from the attic
I run for the sake of a known need
Surrounded by a crowd of slaves
With a menacing despotistic gaze
Afedron you are so fat
You wipe your ass with calico
I am a sinful hole
I don't indulge in children's fashion
And Khvostova with a harsh ode
Even though I frown and rub
You are right Firs the scientist is unbearable
A pompous and sophisticated pedant
He judges everything with importance
He knows a little bit of everything
I love you neighbor Pakhom
You're just stupid and thank God for that
I believe I am loved for the heart you need to believe
No my dear she cannot be a hypocrite
Everything in her is genuine the languid heat of desires
Shyness is the timid Harit's priceless gift
The outfits and speeches have a pleasant casualness
And the tenderness of infantile affection of affectionate names
I know battle I love the sound of swords
From the first years a fan of military glory
I love wars bloody fun
And the thought of death is dear to my soul
In the prime of freedom a faithful warrior
Who has not seen death before him
He didn't taste the full joy
And he is not worthy of the kisses of dear wives
Favorite of the windy Lais
The lovely darling of Cypris
Learn to bear my Adonis
Her momentary grievances
She gave beauty to the young
Charm is your destiny
And a black mustache and a lively look
Love's smile and silence
You're quite a sweet friend
Let him be free from ardent desires
You kiss your girlfriends
You don't enjoy what you need
In the haze of city fun
On the easy games of Terpsichore
To you young beauties
Thoughtful glances fly
Alas the language of love is mute
This sigh of the soul is eloquent
Must be sweet my dear
Selfish carelessness
And you are happy with your destiny
And I am an eternally idle rake
The descendant of negroes is ugly
Raised in wild simplicity
Love without knowing suffering
I am liked by young beauty
With shameless frenzy of desires
With an involuntary flame of cheeks
The young nymph stealthily
Without understanding myself
Sometimes he looks at the faun
I have seen the barren borders of Asia
The far edge of the Caucasus valley is burnt
Dwelling of wild Circassian herds
Podkumka hot bank deserted peaks
Encircled by a crown of flying clouds
And the Trans-Kuban plains
A terrible land of wonders there are hot streams
Boiling in the red-hot cliffs
Blessed streams
Hope true to the disease of those exhausted
My gaze met near the marvelous shores
The withered youths of the apostates feasts
Condemned to secret torments by Cypris
And young warriors on early crutches
And frail old men with sad gray hairs
Alas what does she shine for
With a moment of tender beauty
She's visibly fading
Alive in the bloom of youth
Will fade away with young life
You won't enjoy it for long
Don't please yourself for long
Happy circle of your family
With carefree sweet wit
To enliven our conversations
And with a quiet clear soul
To please the soul of a sufferer
I hurry in the excitement of heavy thoughts
Hiding my despondency
Listen to cheerful speeches
And take a good look at her
I look at all her movements
I listen to every sound of speeches
And a single moment of separation
Terrible to my soul
Why timeless boredom
To feed with ominous thoughts
And the inevitable separation
To wait in timid despondency
And the day of suffering is so close
Alone in the silence of empty fields
You will call memories
The days you lost
Then by exile and grave
You will be unhappy you are ready
Buy at least the word of a sweet maiden
Even the slightest sound of her steps
I don't feel sorry for you my spring year
Passed away in dreams of vain love
I don't feel sorry for you about the mysteries of the nights
Sung by the voluptuous trumpet
I don't feel sorry for you unfaithful friends
Feast wreaths and circular cups
I don't feel sorry for you young traitors
I shun thoughtful amusements
But where are your moments of tenderness
Young hopes of heartfelt silence
Where is the former heat and tears of inspiration
Come again years of my spring
The light of day has gone out
On the blue sea the evening fog fell
Make noise make noise obedient sail
Worry beneath me gloomy ocean
I see a distant shore
The magical lands of the southern lands
I rush there with excitement and longing
Intoxicated by memories
And I feel tears are born in my eyes again
The soul boils and freezes
A familiar dream flies around me
I remembered the crazy love of previous years
And everything that I suffered from and everything that is dear to my heart
The languid deception of desires and hopes
Make noise make noise obedient sail
Worry beneath me gloomy ocean
Fly ship carry me to distant lands
By the terrible whim of the deceptive seas
But not to the sad shores
My foggy homeland
Countries where passions burn
For the first time feelings flared up
Where the gentle muses secretly smiled at me
Where early in the storms it bloomed
My lost youth
Where the light-winged joy betrayed me
And she gave her cold heart over to suffering
Seeker of new experiences
I fled from your father's land
I ran you pets of pleasures
Minute friends of a moment of youth
And you are confidantes of vicious delusions
To whom I sacrificed myself without love
Peace glory freedom and soul
And you are forgotten by me young traitors
Secret friends of my golden spring
And you are forgotten by me But the former wounds of the heart
Nothing has healed the deep wounds of love
Make noise make noise obedient sail
Worry beneath me gloomy ocean
Thunderstorm Moon Freedom Warrior
Blood Covered Saint
Your wonderful father is a criminal and a hero
He was worthy of both the horror of people and glory
He caressed you as a baby
On the fiery chest with a bloody hand
Your toy was a dagger
Sophisticated by fratricide
How often having aroused the heat of fierce revenge
He is silent over your innocent cradle
The murder of the new was being considered
And I listened to your babble and was not a stranger to joy
Such was the gloomy horror to the end
But you are beautiful you are the stormy age of your father
She redeemed herself with a humble life before heaven
From the terrible grave to the heavens
She is like sweet incense
How the pure prayer of love ascended
I look like a madman at the black shawl
And the cold soul is tormented by sadness
When I was gullible and young
I loved the young Greek woman passionately
A lovely maiden caressed me
But soon I lived to see a black day
One day I invited some cheerful guests
A despicable Jew knocked on my door
"They're feasting with you" he whispered "your friends"
Your Greek woman cheated on you
I gave him gold and cursed him
And I called my faithful servant
We went out and I was racing on a fast horse
And gentle pity was silent in me
As soon as I saw the Greek woman's threshold
My eyes darkened and I was completely exhausted
I enter the distant chamber alone
An Armenian kissed an unfaithful girl
I didn't see the light the damask steel thundered
The villain didn't have time to interrupt the kiss
I trampled the headless body for a long time
And he silently looked at the girl turning pale
I remember the blood flowing from prayers
The Greek woman died love died
Having removed the black shawl from her dead head
I silently wiped the bloody steel
My slave as the evening darkness came
Their bodies were thrown into the Danube waves
Since then I have not kissed the lovely eyes
Since then I have not known happy nights
I look like a madman at the black shawl
And the cold soul is tormented by sadness
Khavronios is a hardened scolder
In the darkness in the dust in contempt gray-haired
Calm down my friend what's the point of all this magazine noise
And the tedious stupidity of libels
The prankster will say with a smile "Stupidity"
The ignorant fool will say yawning Mind
In a dark and despicable life
He was immersed for a long time
Long all the ends of the universe
He defiled with debauchery
But not much improvement
He made amends for his shame
And now thank God he is
Just a card thief
Among the green will kissing Tavrida
At dawn I saw Nereid
Hidden among the trees I barely dared to breathe
Above the clear moisture the demigoddess's breast
She raised the young one white as a swan
And she squeezed foam from her hair in a stream
The flying ridge of clouds thins out
Star sad evening star
Your ray silvered the withered plains
And the dormant bay and the black rock peaks
I love your faint light in the sky
He awakened the thoughts that were dormant in me
I remember your sunrise a familiar luminary
Over a peaceful country where everything is dear to the heart
Where the slender poplars rise in the valleys
Where the tender myrtle and dark cypress slumber
And the midday waves make a sweet noise
There once was a time in the mountains full of heartfelt thoughts
I dragged out a thoughtful laziness over the sea
When the shadow of night descended on the huts
And the young maiden looked for you in the darkness
And she called her friends by name
Prince Gso is not familiar to me
I have never seen such a bad mixture
It is composed of meanness and arrogance
But there is more meanness than arrogance in him
In battle he is a coward in a tavern he is a barge hauler
In the hall he is a scoundrel in the living room he is a fool
When across the blue seas
The marshmallow glides and blows softly
Into the sails of proud ships
And the boats are cherished on the waves
Laying down the burden of worries and thoughts
Then I'm more happy when I'm lazy
And I forget the songs of the Muses
I prefer the sweet sound of the sea
When the waves on the shores
They roar boil and splash with foam
And thunder rumbles across the sky
And lightning flashes in the darkness
I am moving away from the seas
Into the hospitable oak groves
The earth seems more reliable to me
And I feel sorry for the stern fisherman
He lives on a fragile boat
Playground of the blind abyss
And I am in safe silence
I listen to the sound of the valley stream
In my infancy she loved me
And she handed me a seven-barreled trumpet
She listened to me with a smile and slightly
Through the ringing wells of empty reeds
I was already playing with weak fingers
And the important hymns inspired by the gods
And the peaceful songs of the Phrygian shepherds
From morning till evening in the silent shade of oak trees
I diligently listened to the lessons of the secret maiden
And delighting me with a random reward
Throwing back the curls from his sweet forehead
She herself took the flute from my hands
The reed was revived by divine breath
And filled the heart with holy charm
I outlived my desires
I fell out of love with my dreams
All that's left for me is suffering
The fruits of the heart's emptiness
Under the storms of cruel fate
My blooming crown has faded
I live sad and lonely
And I wait to see if my end will come
So struck by the late cold
The winter whistle is heard like a storm
One on a naked branch
The belated leaf trembles
War is finally raised
The banners of military honor are rustling
I will see blood I will see a feast of revenge
The deadly lead will whistle around me
And how many strong impressions
For my thirsty soul
The aspirations of the turbulent militias
The alarm of the camp is the sound of swords
And in the fatal fire of battles
The fall of warriors and leaders
Subjects of proud chants
Wake up my sleeping genius
Everything will be new to me the simple canopy of the tent
The fires of their enemies their alien call
Evening drum thunder cannon screeching core
And the expectation of a terrible death
Will you be born in me blind passion of glory
You are the thirst for death the fierce heat of heroes
Will I get a double wreath for a share
Did the fate of battles judge me to a dark end
And all the hopes of my youthful days will die with me
The sacred heat of the heart for high aspirations
Memories of both brother and friends
And the vain excitement of creative thoughts
And you and you love Is it not the noise of abuse
Neither the military labors nor the murmur of proud Glory
Nothing will drown out my usual thoughts
I am a melting victim of evil poison
Peace is running away from me I have no power over myself
And a painful laziness took hold of my soul
Why does the horror of battle linger
Well the first battle hasn't started yet
Friend Delvig my Parnassian brother
I was comforted by your prose
But I confess Baron I am a sinner
I would be more pleased with poetry
You know yourself in the past years
I am on the shores of the Parnassian waters
He loved to scribble poems and odes
And even the people saw me
At the fashion puppet theatre
It happened that I wrote
For others everything does not smell like Russia
Whatever I ask censorship for
Timkovsky will gasp at everything
Now I can barely breathe
The muse withers from abstinence
And I rarely rarely sin with her
I grow cold towards the unfaithful Glory
And just out of habit
I drag myself lazily after her
Like a husband for a proud wife
I forgot her vows
Freedom alone is my idol
But I still love my poets
The happy voice of your lyres
So definitely forgotten today
The pranks of my youth
Your matchmaker looks at you with a smile
For the young people's dalliances
In the country where Julia was crowned
And expelled by the cunning Augustus
Ovid dragged out gloomy days
Where is the elegiac lyre
To your deaf idol
He cowardly dedicated
Far from the northern capital
I forgot your eternal fog
And the free voice of my pipe
Worries sleepy Moldovans
I'm still the same as before
I don't go to an ignoramus with a bow
I argue with Orlov I drink little
Octavia in blind hope
I don't sing prayers of flattery
And light messages to Friendship
I write without strict effort
You are the one who fate gave
And a bold mind and a high spirit
And doomed to important songs
The joy of lonely life
O you who resurrected
Achilles's ghost is majestic
Homer revealed the Muse to us
And the brave singer of glory
Freed from the ringing bonds
Your voice reached the solitude
Where I hid from persecution
The hypocrite and the proud fool
And again he revived the singer
Like the sweet voice of inspiration
Your greetings Phoebus' chosen one
Your praises are precious to me
For the Muses and friendship the poet lives
His enemies are despised by him
He is the Muse of the square battle
Doesn't humiliate in front of the people
And with an instructive vine
Zoila whips in passing
The Lemnos god has bound you
For the hands of immortal Nemesis
Freedom's secret guardian the punishing dagger
The Last Judge of Shame and Resentment
Where Zeus' thunder is silent where the sword of the Law slumbers
You are the executor of curses and hopes
You hide under the shadow of the throne
Under the glitter of festive clothes
Like a hellish ray like the lightning of the gods
A silent blade flashes in the villain's eyes
And looking around he trembles
Among his feasts
Your unexpected blow will find him everywhere
On land on the seas in the temple under tents
Behind the hidden locks
On the bed of sleep in the family
The cherished Rubicon roars under Caesar
The sovereign Rome fell the Law drooped its head
But Brutus a freedom-loving man rebelled
You have struck down Caesar and he embraces him dead
Pompeii marble proud
The spawn of rebellion raises an angry cry
Despicable dark and bloody
Over the headless corpse of Liberty
The ugly executioner appeared
Apostle of death to the tired Hades
He appointed victims with his finger
But the highest court sent him
You and the maiden Eumenis
O young righteous man chosen one of the fatal
O Sand your age died on the chopping block
But the virtues of the saint
The voice remained in the executed dust
In your Germany you have become an eternal shadow
Threatening misfortune to the criminal force
And on the solemn grave
A dagger burns without an inscription
Do the vaults still overshadow
This temple of the three queens of Parnassus
All the same cries of young priestesses
The same round dances are still going on
Has the magic voice fallen silent
Semenova of this wonderful Muse
Will he leave us forever
She broke her marriage with Phoebus
And the ray of Russian glory faded
I don't believe she will rise again
The tribute of hearts is ready for her again
It won't fade away for long before us
Her solemn crown
And for her the lover of glory
Confidant of the important Aonids
Young Katenin will resurrect
Aeschylus is a great genius
And he will return the purple to her
I don't love your Corina
Boringcourtesypictures
There are only tears and sadness in it
And the phrases of Madame de Staël
I prefer living youth
Reason and heart in half
Pleasant flattery fry sweetness
And the courage of caustic epigrams
The fun of jokes and stories
Imagination mind and taste
And that's why my Bezobrazov
To you
Meanwhile General Orlov
Hymen's Shaved Recruit
Burning with sacred passion
I am ready to come within the measure
Meanwhile you are a smart prankster
You spend the night in noisy conversation
And for bottles of Ai
My Raevskys are sitting
When spring is young everywhere
She spread the dirt with a smile
And from grief on the banks of the Danube
Our armless prince is rebelling
You Raevsky and Orlova
And loving the memory of Kamenka
I want to say two words to you
About Chisinau and about myself
These days in the middle of the cathedral
Metropolitan the gray-haired glutton
Before lunch by chance
He ordered all of Russia to live long
And with the son of Birdie and Maria
I went to greet Christ in heaven
I became smart I am a hypocrite
I fast I pray and I firmly believe
That God will forgive my sins
As the sovereign my poems
Inzov is fasting and the other day
I exchanged Parnassian nonsense
And the lyre is a sinful gift of fate
For the Book of Hours and for Mass
Yes on dried mushrooms
However my mind is proud
My remorse scolds
And my unreligious stomach
Have mercy brother he says
When else would the blood of Christ
There was at least Lafite for example
Or would there not be a word then
Just think how funny it is
With water Moldovan wine
But I pray and sigh
I am baptized and do not listen to Satan
And I still involuntarily remember
Davydov about your wine
Here is another Eucharist
When both you and your dear brother
Putting on in front of the fireplace
Democratic robe
The cup of salvation was filled
With a foamless frozen stream
And for the health of both
They drank it down to the last drop
But those in Naples are up to no good
And she is unlikely to be resurrected there
The people want silence
And their yoke will not crack for a long time
Has the ray of hope disappeared
But no we will enjoy happiness
Let us partake of the bloody cup
And I will say Christ is risen
I told you to fear the sweet maiden
I knew she draws hearts with involuntary force
Careless friend I knew I couldn't do it in front of her
To notice others to look for others with eyes
Having lost hope having forgotten the sweetness of betrayal
A thoughtful youth burns near her
Favorites of happiness confidantes of Fate
Humbly they bring her the prayers of lovers
But the proud maiden hates their feelings
And lowering his eyes he does not listen and does not see
Who will send me her portrait
Traits of a beautiful sorceress
Passionate admirer of talents
I was her poet before
Out of frustration she may be wrong
When one in the smoke of incense
The beauty shone with glory
I drowned out the hymns with my whistle
Let evil perish in a single moment
The false sound of the lyre perishes
She is guilty my dear friend
Before Selimena and Moina
So frivolous in soul
O gods a mortal reviles you
But soon with a trembling hand
Brings you new sacrifices
Friend of the idle thought
My inkwell
My century is diverse
I decorated with you
How often is a friend of fun
I forgot with you
Conventional hangover hour
And a festive glass
Under the canopy of a modest hut
In hours of languid sadness
You were in front of me
With a lamp and a dream
In moments of inspiration
I came running to you
And he called upon the Muse
For a feast of imagination
Transparent light smoke
Hovered over you
And with living trepidation
In it in quick succession
 
My treasures
At the bottom of your being lurk
I dedicated you
Leisure activities
And reconciled with Laziness
She is your friend
With you I learned success
The Hermit Unknown
Your treasured crystal
Keeps the heavenly fire
And in the evening when
The pen wanders through the book
Without sluggish labor
It finds you in you
The Ends of My Poems
And the fidelity of expression
Either sounds or words
An unexpected coincidence
That's the salt of a caustic joke
That is the stern style of Truth
That is the strangeness of the new rhyme
Unheard of before
Stripping the fools of their clothes
I branded cheerfully
Zoila and the Ignorant
With your ink stain
But he didn't breed them
No secret anger foam
Not with the poison of slander
And hearts of simplicity
Neither by flattery nor by betrayal
You didn't stain it
But here in the bosom of laziness
I hear gentle singing
Caring friends
Will I really forget them
Friends of my soul
And I will be unfaithful to them
Leave it leave it sometimes
Habitual undertakings
Both dactyl and chorea
For postal prose
Minutes of cold boredom
Emptiness of the heart
The sadness of separation
Everlasting dreams
My hopes feelings
Without flattery without art
Pass it on to the paper
With careless talkativeness
And windy and gentle
Comfort their hearts
Carefree son of nature
While the golden years are here
I waste it in oblivion
Inseparable from me
Live well
My confidante
When is the shore of hell
It will take me forever
When will it sleep forever
The pen is my joy
And you are in an empty corner
Once you become orphaned you will cool down
And you will leave forever
The Poet's Quiet House
Chedayev my dear friend
You will be taken by the sad one
Last hello
To the favorite of previous years
Withered and empty
Between two of his paintings
Remain forever mute
Decorate his fireplace
Demanding light
Don't attract the eyes
But a faithful poet
Remind your friends
Christ is risen my Revka
Today following the soul
The law of God-man
I kiss you my angel
And tomorrow to the faith of Moses
I'm not shy for a kiss
The Jewess is ready to begin
And even then I will hand it over to you
What can a faithful Jew do
Distinguish from the Orthodox
In the country where I forgot the worries of past years
Where are the ashes of Ovid my deserted neighbor
Where glory is a matter of little concern to me
My tired soul misses you
To the enemy of restrictive conditions and shackles
It wasn't hard for me to wean myself off feasts
Where the idle mind shines while the heart sleeps
And the ardent truth is embraced by the coldness of decency
Leaving the noisy circle of young madmen
In my exile I did not regret them
I sighed and left other delusions behind
I have consigned my enemies to the curse of oblivion
And having torn the nets where I fought in captivity
I taste a new silence for my heart
In solitude my wayward genius
I have experienced both quiet work and the thirst for reflection
I own my day my mind is friendly with order
I am learning to hold the attention of long thoughts
I seek reward in the arms of freedom
The years lost in rebellious youth
And in enlightenment to become equal with the century
The goddesses of the world have appeared to me again the Muses
And they smiled at independent leisure
My lips touched the abandoned trenches
The old sound made me happy again
I sing my dreams nature and love
And true friendship and lovely things
Those who captivated me in my infancy
In those days when still unknown to anyone
Knowing no worries no goals no systems
I filled the haven of fun and laziness with my singing
And the Tsarskoye Selo guardian canopy
But there is no friendship with me I see sadness
The azure of foreign skies midday lands
Neither the muses nor the labors nor the joys of leisure
Nothing can replace a single friend
You were the healer of my spiritual powers
O constant friend I have dedicated it to you
And the short life already tested by Fate
And feelings can be saved by you
You knew my heart in the bloom of my youthful days
You saw how later in the excitement of passions
I was secretly languishing a weary sufferer
At the moment of death over the hidden abyss
You supported me with your unsleeping hand
You replaced hope and peace for your friend
Penetrating into the depths of the soul with a stern gaze
You revived her with advice or reproach
Your heat ignited a love for the sublime
Brave patience was born in me again
The voice of slander could not offend me
I knew how to despise knowing how to hate
What need did I have of a solemn trial
A noble ignoramus's serf at the star
Or a philosopher who in former years
He amazed the four parts of the world with his debauchery
But having enlightened himself he atoned for his shame
He gave up wine and became a card thief
Speaker Luzhnikov is not noticed by anyone
He bothered me a little with his harmless barking
Should I complain about the talk of naughty people
About the babbling of the ladies of the Zoilos and fools
And to dismantle the playful idea with gossip
When could I be proud of your friendship
I thank the gods that I have crossed the dark path
Early sorrows weighed on my chest
I am accustomed to sorrows I have settled accounts with Fate
And I will endure life with a stoic soul
One wish: stay with me
I have not tormented the heavens with another prayer
Oh my friend will the time of separation soon come
When we connect words of love and hands
When I hear your heartfelt greetings
As I hug you I see the office
Where you are always a sage and sometimes a dreamer
And the windy crowd's dispassionate observer
I'll come I'll come again my dear homebody
To remember conversations with you from previous years
Young evenings prophetic disputes
Familiar dead people live conversations
Let's argue reread judge scold
Let's revive freedom-loving hopes
And I will be happy but only for God's sake
Drive Sheping away from our doorstep
Who has seen the land where the luxury of nature
Oak groves and meadows are revived
Where the waters merrily rustle and sparkle
And the peaceful ones caress the shores
Where on the hills under the laurel vaults
The gloomy snows do not dare to lie down
Tell me who has seen the lovely land
Where I loved exile unknown
The Golden Limit is Elvina's favorite land
My wishes fly to you
I remember the coastal rapids of rocks
I remember the cheerful streams of water
And shadow and noise and red valleys
Where in the silence of simple Tatar families
Amidst worries and with mutual friendship
Under the roof they live hospitably
Everything is alive there everything is a joy to the eyes
Gardens of the Tatars of the city village
The mass of rocks is reflected by the waves
Ships are lost in the sea distance
Amber hangs on grape vines
The roaming herds make noise in the meadows
And the swimmer sees the grave of Mithridates
Illuminated by the sunset glow
And where the myrtle rustles over the fallen urn
Will I see again through the dark forests
And the vaults of the rocks and the azure shine of the sea
And the skies are clear as joy
Will the excitement of a stormy life subside
Will the beauty of past years be resurrected
Will I come again under the sweet shadows
To fall asleep with my soul in the bosom of peaceful laziness
Yawning from mass
I'm going to Katakazi's house
What kind of Greek nonsense is this
What is this Greek sodom
With legs tucked under
For jam in the cool weather
Like the Egyptian gods
The ladies sweat and remain silent
I confess to all of Europe
The lame one screams
Mavrogenius thick-headed
My soul and heart are tormented
The husband is empty-handed his pockets are heavy
You have made a mess of my family
And in vain you back away
Mavrogenius is dearer to me
Hello round neighbor
You are brutish you are stingy
You are an awkward coquette
You are bald you are stupid
I can't even talk to you
I forgive everything God is with you
You are from morning until dark night
I'm glad to play bank with me
Here is a Jewish woman with Tadarashka
The flame burns in the scoundrel
He keeps his paw under his shirt
The snout on her face
I'm frozen with horror
Oh Jewess God will kill you
If you believe Moses
The bestial woman will die
You are punished today
And Cupid pierced you too
O sensitive matchmaker
O beauty of Moldavian fools
Look every girl
In front of you with a young man
You are my only widow
With the index finger
You are smart and eloquent
Kishinevskaya Janlis
You are white fat and funny
Bug-eyed Tarsis
I don't want to judge harshly
But my soul doesn't cling to you
So listen for God's sake
Be stupid and be good
Recently a poor Muslim
He lived in Yurzuf with his children and wife
I revered the sacred Alcoran with all my heart
And he was happy with his fate
Mehmet was his name and he worked hard all day long
I went to look for the hives and the herd
And for home-grown grapes
Not knowing what laziness is
He loved his wife Fatima knew it
And every year she bore him children
In our opinion friends even though it’s funny
But that’s the way it is with the Tatars
Fatima once she at that time
Carried a three-month burden
And everyone knows that in these times
And even the most sedate wife
He has whims sometimes these sometimes others
And God forbid any
Fatima speaks sweetly to her husband
My friend I really want kaymak
I'm losing my memory and my mind
My stomach is burning inside me
I didn't sleep all night and look at the shower
Today I really feel very unwell
I have to be afraid of everything
I don't even dare scratch myself
So that you don’t give birth to a baby with sour cream on its nose
I can't bear such torment
My dear cute handsome friend
Get me at least a tiny piece of kaymak
Mehmet got soft got ready and tied up
Put a tin plate in the sash
He blessed the children and kissed his wife
And immediately he ran into the nearby valley
To please the sick
He didn't walk but flew on the way back
He set off through the mountains barely walking
And soon he began to search completely exhausted
A place to relax
Luckily at the end of the valley
He saw a stream
He reached the shores and lay down in the shade of the branches
The murmur of waters tree tops
Fragrant grass cool shore
And shadow and a light breeze
Everything undead said everything
Love or rest Love such ideas
It never occurred to Mehmet
Although he could But sleep is cute
More reasonable and more faithful
For that reason Mehmet as king fell asleep in the valley
Let's assume that kings are given the opportunity to sleep pleasantly
Under a canopy on a feather bed
Although this is tricky
A caustic poet a witty intricate wit
And rich in the brilliance of sharp words and jokes
Happy Vyazemsky I envy you
You got the right thanks to fate
Laugh merrily at jealous malice
Ignorance strikes with playful anathema
Elleferia is before you
other delights were attivated
I burn with you always yours
I am yours forever Elleferia
The noise of the light scares you
Court glitter is unpleasant
I love your passionate right mind
And your voice is clear to the heart
In the south in peaceful darkness
Live with me Elleferia
To your beauty
Cold Russia is harmful
Accept the new notebook
You are young men and you are young women
Isn't it more fun for you to read
Playful Muse of Fables
Than Pindaric praises
High-flown pages
Or a soporific journal
Which was once in fashion
And now it is so heavy and rough
Which is contrary to nature
Wants to be evil and only stupid
O you who loved
Parnassus Secret Flowers
And willful dreams
They rewarded me with weak attention
Save my careless work
Under the canopy of the veil
From the hands of blind Ignorance
From the slanting gaze of envy
Pictures of thoughts and stories
I mixed it up again for you
Funny combined with important
And the mad love of leprosy
Found in the archives of hell
Chromid is in love with you he is young and more than once
We both secretly noticed you
You listen to him in silence blushing
Your downcast gaze burns with desire
And long after Dioneus
Your face keeps a gentle smile
If with gentle beauty
You are sensitive in soul
If someone else's grief
It's terrible for you to be guilty
If it is hard for you to remember
Victim of secret suffering
I will not leave these sheets
My memories
Hussar singer you sang bivouacs
A bounty of dashing feasts
And the terrible fun of a fight
And the curls of his mustache
From the merry strings to the days of peace
Blowing away the dust on the march
You praised the lyre of perestroika
Love and a Peace Bottle
I listen to you and my heart grows younger
The heat of your speech is sweet to me
The sad one is burning again
Reminiscing about old days
I still love the language of passions
Its captivating sounds
Pleasant to me as the voice of friends
In the sad days of separation
Here is the Muse a lively chatterbox
Which you loved so much
My naughty girl repented
The courtly tone captivated her
The Almighty overshadowed her
With your heavenly grace
She is spiritually engaged
Dangerous sacrifices the game
Don't be surprised my dear
Her Israeli dress
Forgive her for her past sins
And under the cherished seal
Accept dangerous verses
In smoke in blood through clouds of arrows
Now it's your turn
But you foresee your fate
Our coming Quiroga
And soon soon the fighting will cease
Among the slave people
You will take a hammer in your hand
And freedom will call
I praise you O faithful brother
O venerable mason
O Kishinev O dark city
Rejoice the enlightened one
Aglaya to her lover without resistance
She gave in but he was pale and powerless
I was finally exhausted and exhausted
Completely out of breath he contented himself with a bow
Aglaya spoke to him in an arrogant tone
Tell me sir why is my appearance
You are chilled can you explain the reason
Disgust oh my god not that
Too much love No too much respect
I will soon fall silent But if on a day of sorrow
The strings answered me with a thoughtful play
But if the young men listen to me silently
They marveled at my long torment of love
But if you yourself are overcome with emotion
She recited sad poems in silence
And the passionate language of my heart loved
But if I love you let me my dear friend
Let me animate the farewell sound of the lyre
The cherished name of the beautiful mistress
When the sleep of death embraces me forever
Speak with tenderness over my urn
He was loved by me he was lent to me
And songs and love are the last inspiration
My friend the traces of past years have been forgotten by me
And the rebellious flow of my youth
Don't ask me about things that don't exist anymore
What was given to me for sorrow and for pleasure
What I loved that changed me
Let me taste joy not in full
But you are innocent you were born for happiness
Carelessly trust him catch the fleeting moment
Your soul is alive for friendship and love
For kisses of lust
Your soul is pure despondency is alien to it
A child's conscience is as bright as a clear day
Why should you listen to madness and passions
Not an entertaining story
She will involuntarily disturb your quiet mind
You will shed tears your heart will tremble
The carelessness of a trusting soul will fly away
And you might be horrified by my love
Maybe forever No my dear
I'm afraid of losing my last pleasures
Don't demand dangerous revelations from me
Today I love today I am happy
He disappeared
Love fun pet gentle
Deep sleep surrounds him
And the cold of a serene grave
He loved the games of our girls
When in the spring in the shade of the trees
They were spinning freely
But now in a lively round dance
His chorus can no longer be heard
How long ago did the elders admire
His cheerfulness is alive
They smiled half-sadly
And they talked among themselves
And we loved round dances
Our minds also shone
But wait the years will come
And you will be what we are now
How do we know the world's playful guest
You will be ashamed of the white light
Now play But the elders are alive
And he faded in the prime of life
And without him friends are feasting
Having already managed to love others
It's rare that they name it
His in the conversation of young girls
Of the dear wives who loved him
One may be shedding tears
And the memory of the joys of the departed
The usual thought calls
For what
Over the clear waters
Tombs of a peaceful family
Under the tilted crosses
They hide in the centuries-old grove
There on the edge of the big road
Where the old linden tree rustles
Forgetting the worries of the heart
Our poor young man lies
In vain does the ray of dawn shine
Or does the moon walk among the skies
And around the insensible tomb
The stream babbles and the forest whispers
In vain in the morning for raspberries
A beauty with a basket to the stream
It goes even in the cold spring
He lowers his leg timidly
Nothing causes it
From the peaceful shade of the grave
Tadarashka is in love with you
And for your legs
They say he's a turn-on
A kind of droshky
It doesn't come easy to us
How careless
Oh it's far away in a droshky
You can leave
A wonderful fate has been fulfilled
A great man has died out
In gloomy captivity he rolled away
Napoleon's terrible age
The condemned ruler has disappeared
The mighty darling of victories
And for the exile of the universe
The offspring is already coming
Oh whose bloody memory are you
The world will be full for a long long time
Overshadowed by your glory
Sleeping among the deserted waves
A magnificent grave
Above the urn where your ashes lie
The hatred of the nations has died
And the ray of immortality burns
How long ago did your eagles fly
Over the disgraced land
How long ago did kingdoms fall
In the thunder of fatal force
Obedient to the willful will
The banners rustled with misfortune
And the sovereign imposed the yoke
You are on the earthly tribes
When illuminated by hope
The world has awakened from slavery
And the Gaul with his enraged right hand
He cast down his old idol
When on the rebellious square
The royal corpse lay in the dust
And the great day is inevitable
The bright day of freedom arose
Then in the excitement of the people's storms
Foreseeing his wonderful destiny
In his noble hopes
You have despised humanity
Into your fatal happiness
You believed with a bold soul
You were captivated by autocracy
Disappointed beauty
And a renewed people
You have tamed the youthful wildness
Newborn Freedom
Suddenly she became numb and lost her strength
Among the slaves to the point of intoxication
You have quenched your thirst for power
He rushed their militias to battle
Their chains were entwined with laurels
And France is the gainer of glory
The captive gaze was fixed
Forgetting the great hopes
To his own glorious disgrace
You led swords to a plentiful feast
Everything fell with a roar before you
Europe was perishing in a graveyard sleep
Hovered over her head
And behold in shameful greatness
The colossus stepped onto her chest
Tilsit at this offensive sound
Now the Russian will not turn pale
Tilsit of the haughty hero
Crowned with the last glory
But the boring world but the coldness of peace
The lucky man's soul was stirred
Arrogant who moved you
Who possessed your wonderful mind
How the hearts of Russians were not understood
You from the heights of courageous thoughts
Generous fire
Without knowing it you dreamed
That we are waiting for peace again as a gift
But it was too late to figure out the Russians
Russia the war queen
Remember the ancient rights
Darken the sun of Austerlitz
Burn Great Moscow
Different times have come
Let our brief shame disappear
Bless Moscow Russia
War will destroy our treaty
With numb hands
Grasping his iron crown
He sees the abyss before his eyes
He dies he dies at last
Europe's militias are fleeing
Bloody snows
They proclaimed their fall
And the trace of the enemy melts with them
And everything boiled like a storm
Europe has broken its captivity
It flew after the tyrant
Like thunder the curse of the tribes
And the hand of the people's Nemesis
The giant sees the risen
And to the last all the grievances
You have been repaid tyrant
His gains are redeemed
And the evil of warlike miracles
With the melancholy of stifling exile
Under the shadow of alien skies
And the sultry island of confinement
The midnight sail will visit
And the traveler a word of reconciliation
He will draw on that stone
Where with eyes fixed on the waves
The exile remembered the sound of swords
And the icy horror of midnight
And the sky of France
Where sometimes in your desert
Forgetting the war the offspring of the throne
One by one about a sweet son
In bitter despondency he thought
Let it be darkened by shame
He who is faint-hearted on this day
The madman will be outraged by reproach
His debunked shadow
Praise be to the Russian people
The high lot indicated
And eternal freedom to the world
From the darkness of exile he bequeathed
Greek faithful don't cry he fell a hero
The enemy's lead sank into his chest
Don't cry didn't you tell him before the first fight
She appointed a bloody path of Honor
Then with a heavy premonition of separation
Your husband extended his solemn hand to you
He blessed his baby with tears
But the black banner rustled with freedom
How Aristogiton wrapped his sword in myrtle
He rushed into battle and fell
Great holy work
Ovid I live near the quiet shores
To whom the exiled paternal gods
You once brought and left your ashes
Your joyless cry has made these places famous
And the lyre's gentle voice has not yet become mute
This land is still filled with your rumors
You have made a vivid impression on my imagination
The poet's gloomy desert is his imprisonment
Foggy vault of heaven ordinary snow
And the meadows warmed by brief warmth
How often I am carried away by the play of sad strings
I followed you with my heart Ovid
I saw your ship as a plaything of waves
And the anchor dropped near the wild shores
Where a cruel reward awaits the singer of love
There are fields without shadows hills without grapes
Born in the snow for the horrors of war
There are the fierce sons of cold Scythia
Behind Istra hiding they await prey
And the villages are threatened with raids every moment
There are no obstacles for them they swim in the waves
And they walk fearlessly across the resonant ice
You yourself marvel Nazon marvel at the perverse fate
From your youth you have despised the excitement of military life
Accustomed to crowning my hair with roses
And spend carefree hours in bliss
You will be forced to put on a heavy helmet
And keep the formidable sword near the timid lyre
Neither daughter nor wife nor faithful host of friends
Neither the Muses the light friends of former days
The banished singer will not be consoled by sorrows
In vain did your verses crown the Graces
In vain do young men remember them by heart
Neither glory nor summer nor complaints nor sadness
Neither the timid songs of Octavia will touch
The days of your old age will sink into oblivion
A luxurious citizen of golden Italy
In the homeland of the barbarians unknown and alone
You don't hear the sounds of your homeland around you
You write to a distant friendship in great sorrow
O return to me the sacred city of my fathers
And the peaceful shadows of ancestral gardens
O friends bring my prayers to Augustus
Deflect the punishing hand with tears
But if the angry god is still relentless
And I will never see you great Rome
With a final prayer softening the terrible fate
Bring my coffin at least closer to beautiful Italy
Whose cold heart despised the Harit
Your despondency and tears will be reproached
Who in crude pride will read without emotion
These elegies are the last creations
Where did you pass on your futile groan to your descendants
I a stern Slav did not shed tears
But I understand that they are self-willed exiles
And dissatisfied with the world and with himself and with life
With a thoughtful soul I have now visited
The country where you once dragged out a sad century
Here you have revived the dreams of the imagination
I repeated your Ovidian songs
And he trusted their sad pictures
But the gaze betrayed the deceived dreams
Your exile captivated the eyes in secret
Accustomed to the snows of gloomy midnight
Here the azure sky shines for a long time
Here the cruelty of winter storms reigns briefly
There is a new settler on the Scythian shores
Son of the south the grapes shine purple
Already cloudy December on Russian meadows
He spread out layers of fluffy snow
Winter breathed there and with the spring warmth
Here the clear sun rolled over me
The withered meadow was full of young greenery
The free fields were already being plowed by the early plow
A slight breeze blew towards evening becoming colder
The barely transparent ice over the lake is growing dimmer
The motionless streams were covered with crystal
I remembered your timid experiments
This day is marked by winged inspiration
When you first entrusted with bewilderment
Steps to the waves shackled by winter
And on the new ice it seemed before me
Your shadow glided and plaintive sounds
They came from afar like a languid groan of separation
Take comfort Ovid's crown has not faded
Alas among the crowd the singer is lost
I will be unknown to new generations
And the dark victim will die my weak genius
With a sad life with a momentary rumor
But if my late descendant speaks of me
Having learned he will come to search in this distant country
Near the glorious ashes my lonely trace
Leaving the cold shadow of oblivion on the shores
My grateful shadow will fly to him
And his memory will be sweet to me
May the cherished tradition be preserved
How do you submit to the hostile fate
It was not by glory or fate that I was equal to you
Here with the lyre of the northern desert resounding
I wandered in those days as if on the banks of the Danube
The magnanimous Greek called for freedom
And not a single friend in the world listened to me
But the alien hills fields and groves are sleepy
And the peaceful muses were kind to me
Try to observe various signs
Shepherd and farmer in infancy
Looking up at the sky at the western shadow
They can already predict both the wind and a clear day
And the May rains bring joy to the young fields
And the early frost is dangerous for the grapes
So if the swans are in the bosom of quiet waters
Splashing in the evening they will call out your arrival
Or the bright sun will set into sad clouds
Know that tomorrow the sleepy maidens will be awakened by roaring rain
Or the hail beating against the windows and the early peasant
Getting ready to mow the high grain of the valleys
Hearing the noise of the storm he won't go to work
And plunge again into lazy slumber
And you could believe me
Like simple-minded Agnes
In which novel did you find
So that the rake dies of love
Listen you are thirty years old
Yes a little more than thirty years
I'm in my twenties and I've seen the light
I spun around in it for a long time at will
I find vows and tears funny
The pranks have become tiresome
To you too from your side
Treason is truly boring
Having settled down we cooled off
It's not time for us to study again
We know eternal love
Lives for barely three weeks
We were friends from the beginning
But boredom is the case of a jealous husband
I pretended to be crazy
And you pretended to be shy
We swore then alas
Then they forgot our oath
You fell in love with Cleon
And I have my confidante Natasha
We've been separated for so long
Everything is good and decent
Could we live without distant quarrels
Again friendly and calm
But not this morning
You are suddenly in a tragic heat
The gray antiquity was resurrected
You are preaching again
Love of the deceased knights
Polite heat and sadness and jealousy
Have mercy no right no
I am not a child even though I am a poet
As we go downhill
Let's leave the youthful ardor of passions
You are your eldest daughter
I am to my little brother
They can have fun with life
And prepare tears for yourself in the future
It is also fitting for them to love
And it's time for us to gossip
Leaving honor to fate
Davydova is a living victim of the furies
From a young age I loved the opposite sex
And suddenly trouble punishes her Mercury
It's time for her to repent
She lies there her eyes swelling little by little
Suddenly he burst what a lady thank God
Everything is for the best here is a new hole
Don't pretend my dear friend
My opponent is broad-shouldered
You are not afraid of the sound of the lyre
Neither elegiac speeches
Give me your hand you are not jealous
I am too flighty and lazy
Your beauty is not stupid
I see everything and I'm not angry
She is lovely Laura
Yes I'm not fit for Petrarch
My dear how unfair
Your jealous dreams
I have forgotten the calls of love
And the captivity of dangerous beauty
Freedom's peace-loving friend
In the crowd of young beauties
I am indifferent and lazy
I don't see my gods in them
Their languid gaze is a welcoming babble
No longer have power over me
The heart has forgotten its tender tremor
And the flame of youth is alive
Now it's hard for me to fall in love
Sighing is awkward and funny
It is foolish to trust in hope
It is a sin to deceive your husbands
The joyful holiday of life has passed
Like my thoughtful prankster
As Baratynsky says I repeat
Is it possible to find a gentle friend
Is it possible to find reliable love
And I find nothing
Leaving behind the false phantom of happiness
Without intoxicating passions
I became a cautious confidant
My inexperienced friends
When the lover is frantic
Longingly cries before me
And for the haughty beauty
Vows to sacrifice himself
When in the heat of your desires
He explains with delight
Vague dark expectations
A deceptive but sweet dream
And squeezing his friend's hand tightly
Curses a jealous husband
Or a nagging mother
His crazy assurances
And minute-by-minute repetitions
I love to listen with participation
I flatter his blind hope
I am young with someone else's youth
And I say it was like that before
In time it happened to me
Into your chamber my gentle friend
I am coming for the last time
Happy serene love
I share my last hour with you
Forward alone in languid hope
Don't wait for me in the middle of the dark night
Until the first morning rays
Don't burn candles
Don't wish for someone else's good
You God command me
But you know the extent of my strength
Should I control tender feelings
I don't want to offend my friend
And I don't want to sit down
I don't need his ox
I look at everything calmly
Neither his house nor his cattle nor his slave
All goodness is not flattering to me
But if his slave
Beautiful Lord I'm weak
And if his girlfriend
Mila is like an angel in the flesh
Oh righteous God forgive me
I envy my friend's bliss
Who could command the heart
Who is a slave to useless efforts
How can you not love kind people
How can one not wish for the blessings of heaven
I look at it languishing and sighing
But I know how to honor strict duty
I'm afraid to flatter the desires of the heart
I am silent and secretly I suffer
This deserted country
Sacred to the poet's soul
She was sung by Derzhavin
And full of Russian glory
To this day the shadow of Naso
Danube seeks shores
She flies to the sweet call
Pets of the Muses and Apollo
And with her often under the moon
I wander along the steep bank
But it's sweeter for me to hug a friend
There is a living Ovid in you
Another had my Aglaya
For his uniform and black moustache
I understand other people for money
Another one because he was French
Cleon frightened her with his mind
Damis for singing tenderly
Tell me now my friend Aglaya
Why did your husband fuck you
Scold grumble blockhead blockheads
You won't wait my friend Lanovoy
Slaps from my hand
Your solemn face
It looks so much like a woman's ass
What only asks for jelly
Yesterday was a day of noisy separation
Yesterday was Bacchus's wild feast
At the cries of mad youth
At the thunder of the cups at the sound of the lyres
So the Muses have blessed you
Wreaths from above autumn
When did you distinguish others
I am honored with a cup of honor
With ambitious gilding
Without blinding our eyes
She is not a vain work
It wasn't the carving that captivated us
But it was distinguished by only one thing
That I thirst for the Scythian belt
The bottle was full and poured in
In its wide edges
I drank and thought in my heart
In days gone by I flew
And the grief of a fleeting life
And I remembered dreams of love
Their betrayal made me laugh
And the sorrow disappeared before me
How foam disappears in bowls
Under the hissing stream
How the prophetic Oleg is now gathering
Take revenge on the foolish Khozars
Their villages and fields for a violent raid
He doomed to swords and fires
With his squad in Constantinople armor
The prince rides across the field on his faithful horse
From the dark forest to meet him
The inspired wizard is coming
The old man submissive to Perun alone
Herald of the covenants of the future
Having spent his whole life in prayers and fortune telling
And Oleg rode up to the wise old man
Tell me wizard beloved of the gods
What will come true in my life
And soon to the delight of our enemy neighbors
I’ll be covered with grave earth
Reveal to me the whole truth don't be afraid of me
As a reward you will take any horse
The Magi are not afraid of the mighty rulers
But they don’t need a princely gift
Their prophetic language is true and free
And friendly with the will of heaven
The coming years are hidden in the darkness
But I see your destiny on your bright forehead
Remember now my word
Glory is a warrior's joy
Thy name is glorified by victory
Your shield is on the gates of Constantinople
Both the waves and the land are submissive to you
The enemy envies such a wonderful fate
And the deceptive wave of the blue sea
In the hours of fatal bad weather
And a sling and an arrow and a cunning dagger
The years spare the winner
Under your formidable armor you know no wounds
An invisible guardian is given to the mighty
Your horse is not afraid of dangerous work
He senses the master's will
Then the meek one stands under the arrows of enemies
It rushes across the battlefield
And the cold and the battle are nothing to him
But you will accept death from your horse
Oleg smiled but his forehead
And the gaze was darkened by thought
Leaning silently with his hand on the saddle
He gets off his horse sullen
And a faithful friend with a parting hand
And he strokes and pats the cool one on the neck
Farewell my comrade my faithful servant
It's time for us to part
Now rest you won't step foot again
Into your gilded stirrup
Farewell console yourself and remember me
You guys take the horse
Cover the blanket with a shaggy rug
Take me to my meadow under the mouths
Bathe and feed with selected grain
Drink spring water
And the youths immediately departed with the horse
And they brought another horse to the prince
The prophetic Oleg feasts with his retinue
When the merry glass clinks
And their curls are white as morning snow
Above the glorious head of the mound
They remember the days gone by
And the battles where they fought together
And where is my friend Oleg said
Tell me where is my spirited horse
Is his running still as healthy and easy
Is he still the same stormy playful one
And he listens to the answer on the steep hill
He has long since fallen into a deep sleep
Mighty Oleg hung his head
And he thinks What is fortune telling
You are a magician a lying crazy old man
I would despise your prediction
My horse would still carry me today
And he wants to see the horse's bones
Here comes the mighty Oleg from the yard
Igor and old guests are with him
And they see on the hill by the bank of the Dnieper
Noble bones lie
The rain washes them the dust covers them
And the wind stirs the feather grass above them
The prince quietly stepped on the horse's skull
And said Sleep friend of the lonely one
Your old master outlived you
The funeral feast is already imminent
It's not you who will stain the feather grass with an axe
And you will water my ashes with hot blood
So this is where my doom was hidden
The bone threatened me with death
From the dead head the grave snake
Hissing meanwhile crawled out
Like a black ribbon wrapped around my legs
And the suddenly stung prince cried out
The circular ladles foam and hiss
At Oleg's mournful funeral
Prince Igor and Olga are sitting on the hill
The squad is feasting on the shore
Fighters remember days gone by
And the battles where they fought together
My friend has been here for three days now
I'm sitting under arrest
And I haven't seen you
Long time ago with my Orestes
Savior of the Moldovans
Bakhmetev's deputy
Herald of the Laws
Humble John
Because the Iasi gentleman
The idiot we know
Mazurka with a turban
An obnoxious beard
Both a coward and a boor
I beat him up a little bit
And what scared the boyars
I have a new anxiety
To my strict canurka
Posted a guard
 
Innocent vanity
Namely I am defiling
Careless features
I write cartoons
So many familiar faces
Eastern figures
Kukonits
And their horned husbands
Shaved and bearded
Tsar Nikita once lived
Idle fun rich
Didn't do good or evil
And his land flourished
The king worked little by little
Ate drank and prayed to God
And from different mothers
Had forty daughters
Forty lovely girls
Forty angels of heaven
Dear in heart and soul
What a leg oh my god
And the head is dark haired
Miracle eyes miracle voice
It could drive you crazy
In a word from head to toe
The soul and heart were captivated by everything
One thing was missing
What is the only thing
So nothing special
Nothing or very little
It was still not enough
How can I explain this
So as not to make him angry at all
A pious important fool
Too prim censorship
What to do Help me God
Between the princesses' legs
No that's too clear
And it's dangerous for modesty
Somehow else
I love Venus's breasts
Sponge the leg especially
But the fire of love
The goal of my desire
What is Nothing
Nothing or very little
And that never happened
The young princesses
Playful and lively
Their miraculous birth
It left me perplexed
All the court hearts
It was sad for my father
And for sad mothers
And from midwives
How did the people find out about it
Everyone here gaped
Ahal ohal was amazed
And another one even laughed
Yes quietly so that we can set off on our way
You can't get to Nerchinsk
The king summoned his courtiers
Nannies and submissive mothers
They were given such an order
If any of you
He will teach his daughters sin
Or he will teach them to think
Or just hint
What are they missing
Or will he say something ambiguous
Or he'll give them the fig
I'm not used to joking
I'll cut out the women's tongues
And for men it's something worse
Which is sometimes even harder
The king was strict but fair
And the order is eloquent
Everyone bowed in fear
Everyone decided to be careful
Everyone kept their ears open
And he kept his property
The poor wives were afraid
So that the husbands don't blab
Secretly the husbands thought
My wife is guilty
Apparently their hearts were angry
My princesses have grown up
I felt sorry for them The Tsar came to the council
I outlined my subject there
So it's pretty clear anyway
Quietly in a whisper unspoken
Be careful with the servants
The boyars became thoughtful
How to treat such an ailment
Here is one old adviser
He bowed to everyone and suddenly
He hit his bald forehead with his hand
And he gave the king such a hoot
O wise sovereign
Do not blame me for my insolence
If about carnal abomination
I'll tell you what happened in the old days
I knew a matchmaker
Where is she and what is she doing today
True to what it was
The woman was known as a witch
She helped with all ailments
The weakness of the limbs was healed
I wish I could find her
The witch will fix everything
And he will insert whatever is needed
So send for her now
Tsar Nikita exclaims
With eyebrows furrowed angrily
Find the witch immediately
If she deceives us
What is needed will not be available
He'll get us by on beans
Or he will lie intentionally
If I were not a king I would be a slacker
If on Clean Monday
I won't order the witch to be burned
And I will beg heaven for this
Here's a secret careful one
By courier travel document
And to all ends of the earth
Messengers were sent
They jump and prowl everywhere
And they are looking for a witch for the king
A year passes and another
There is no news at all
Finally one zealous one
Suddenly I came across a lucky trail
He drove into a dark forest
Apparently the devil himself was leading him
He sees a hut in the forest
There is a witch and an old woman living in it
How he was the Tsar's ambassador
Then he went straight to her
Bowed boldly to the witch
Explained the king's case
How princesses are born
And what are all deprived of
The witch immediately figured it all out
She pushed the messenger through the door
So saying Go away
Hurry up and don't look back
Otherwise be afraid of fever
Come back in three days
For the parcel and the answer
Just remember a little at dawn
Afterwards the witch locked herself in
I stocked up on coal
She conjured for three days
So the devil was lured
To send to the palace
He himself brought her the casket
Full of sinful things
Adored by us
There were all sorts of them there
All sizes all colors
All the best with curls
The witch tried everything
Forty best reports
I wrapped them in a napkin
And she locked it in a chest with a key
She sent a messenger with him
Having given some silver on the way
He is riding Zarya blushed
I wanted to take a rest
I felt like having a snack
I quench my thirst with vodka
He was a neat little fellow
Everyone stock up for the return journey
Here he unbridled the horse
And he began to eat peacefully
The horse is grazing He is dreaming
How his king will exalt him
He will call me a count or a prince
What does the box contain
What does the witch send to the king in it
He looks through the crack no he can't see it
Locked tightly How offensive
Curiosity takes over fear
And everything worries him
He will put his ear to the lock
The ear does not hear anything
A familiar spirit sniffs
Ugh what a miracle!
It's not a bad thing to look at by golly
And the messenger could not stand it
But as soon as he opened the chest
The birds fluttered and flew away
And all around they sat on the branches
And they started wagging their tails
Our messenger let's call them
Entice them with crackers
It's all crumbs in vain
Apparently they are feeding on the wrong things
They sing beautifully on the branches
Why sit in a chest
Here he is dragging himself along the road
All bent over in an arc
An old woman with a crutch
Our messenger fell at her feet
I'll be completely lost
Help me dear mother
Look at this mess
I can't catch them
How can I help with grief
The old woman looked up
She spat and hissed
You acted badly though
But don't cry don't grieve
Just show them
They'll probably all fly off on their own
Well thank you he said
And only just showed
The birds flew to him in an instant
And they took possession of the apartment
So as not to know another misfortune
He is without further excuses
All forty of them are immediately under lock and key
And went home
How the princesses got them
They were put straight into cages
The king was so happy
He immediately threw a huge feast
They feasted for seven days in a row
We rested for a whole month
The Tsar rewarded the entire council
And I didn't forget the witch
From the Kunstkamera as a gift
He sent her a candle stub in alcohol
The one who amazed everyone
Two echidnas two skeletons
From the same office
The messenger was also awarded
That's the end of the story
I love your unknown twilight
And your secret flowers
Oh you lovely poetry
Blessed Dreams
You have assured us poets
That the shadows are a light crowd
From the shores of cold Lethe
They flock to the shore of the earth
And they visit invisibly
Places where everything was sweeter
And in dreams they console
Hearts of Forsaken Friends
They taste immortality
They are awaited in Elysium
How the family awaits the feast
Their slow guests
But maybe the dreams are empty
Perhaps with a coffin robe
I will abandon all earthly feelings
And the earthly world will be alien to me
Maybe where everything shines
With imperishable glory and beauty
Where pure flame devours
Imperfection of Being
Minutes of life impressions
My soul will not keep
I will know no regrets
I will forget the longing of love
You are my pleasure again
The dark thoughts in my soul have subsided
Monotonous excitement
Feelings are resurrected mind is clear
Some kind of unknown bliss
I am filled with some kind of sadness
Animated fields
The hills of Taurida are a lovely land
I visit you again
I languidly drink the air of voluptuousness
It's as if I hear a close voice
Long lost happiness
A happy land where the waters sparkle
Caressing the lush shores
And the bright luxury of nature
The hills of the meadow are illuminated
Where the frowning vaults of the rocks
Behind her along the slope of the mountains
I walked along an unknown road
And he noticed my timid gaze
The footprints of her lovely
Why didn't you dare to leave her traces
Touch with hot lips
Sprinkling them with burning tears
There is never a stormy day
Of my rebellious youth
I didn't want it with such excitement
Kiss the lips of young Circes
And breasts full of languor
I am the only one left
Feasts of mistress friends
Disappeared with light dreams
My youth has faded
With her unfaithful gifts
So the candles burn in debt all night long
For frisky young men and women
At the end of the mad feasts
They turn pale before the rays of day
I am not proud of my singer
What he was able to attract with poetry
Attention of fiery hearts
Playing with laughter and tears
I'm not proud of that sometimes
My insidious chants
They humbled the young maiden in her thoughts
The excitement of fear and shame
Not like the one at the satire pillar
I executed debauchery and malice
And what is the threatening voice of the lyre
The untruth brought horror
What an unyielding inspiration
And my stormy youth
And by passion of will and persecution
I became famous among people
Other highest award
It was my destiny
The joy of selfish thoughts
Dreams of a vain sleep
On the quiet shores of Moscow
Churches crowned with crosses
The ancient chapters shine
Above the monastery walls
The hills spread all around
Groves never cut down
They have been resting there for a long time
Saint relics of the saint
You were born to ignite
Imagination of poets
To disturb and captivate him
With the kind liveliness of greetings
Eastern strangeness of speech
With the sparkle of mirrored eyes
And with this immodest little foot
You were born for languid bliss
For the intoxication of passions
Tell me when Leila's singer
In heavenly dreams I painted
Your unchanging ideal
Wasn't it you he was portraying
The poet is tormented and sweet
Maybe in the distant side
Under the sky of sacred Greece
You are an inspired sufferer
Did I know or did I see it as if in a dream
And the unforgettable image disappeared
In the depths of his heart
Perhaps with a happy lyre
The wizard tempted you
An involuntary trepidation arose
In your proud chest
And you lean towards his shoulder
No no my friend dreams jealous
I don't want to feed the flame
For a long time happiness was alien to me
I can enjoy it again
And we are tormented by a secret sadness
I'm afraid everything that's cute is wrong
Are you burning our lamp
Friend of vigils and feasts
Are you boiling golden cup
In the hands of funny wits
Are you still the same friends of fun
Friends of Cypris and Poems
Hours of love hours of hangover
Do they still fly to the call
Freedom of laziness and idleness
In boring exile every hour
Burning with envious desire
I fly to you with memories
I imagine I see you
Here it is a hospitable shelter
A haven of love and free muses
Where with them by mutual oath
We have sealed an eternal union
Where we knew the bliss of friendship
Where in the cap at the round table
The sweet equality sat down
Where is the capricious tyranny
Changed bottles of conversations
Stories of the naughty song
And our arguments flared up
From sparks and jokes and wine
I hear again the faithful poets
Your enchanted tongue
Pour me some comet wine
Wish me health Kalmyk
You are right my friend in vain I have despised
Gifts of a benevolent nature
I knew the leisure of the carefree Muses was the lot of
And the pleasures of sleepy laziness
Beauty Lais cherished feasts
And cries of mad joy
And the peaceful Muses' momentary gifts
And the babble of noisy glory
I knew friendship and young life
He gave her his windy years
And he believed her over the circular cup
In hours of fun and freedom
I knew love not as gloomy melancholy
Not a hopeless delusion
I knew love as a delightful dream
With enchantment and intoxication
Leaving behind the glitter and noise of youthful conversations
I knew both work and inspiration
And I found the hot thoughts sweet
Solitary excitement
But everything passed the blood in the heart cooled down
In their nakedness I now see
And light and life and friendship and love
And I hate dark experiences
The spirited nature has lost its stamp
The soul grows numb from hour to hour
There are no feelings in her anymore the oak grove leaf is so light
In the Caucasian springs it turns to stone
Having exposed the captivating idol
I see an ugly ghost
But what is now troubling the cold world
Souls insensitive and idle
Did he really seem like that to me before
So majestic and beautiful
Is it really in this shameful depth
I enjoyed the clear heart
What did the young madman see in him
What was I looking for what was I striving for
Whom with an exalted soul
He was not ashamed to idolize
I spoke before a cold crowd
Language of Free Truth
But for the crowd insignificant and deaf
The voice of the noble heart is ridiculous
Everywhere the yoke of an ax or a crown
Everywhere there is a villain or a coward
Tyrant flatterer
Or an obedient slave to prejudices
The gloomy guard of the Muses my long-time persecutor
Today I decided to reason with you
Don't be afraid I don't want to be seduced by false thoughts
To vilify censorship with careless slander
What London needs is too early for Moscow
I know what kind of writers we have
Their thoughts are not oppressed by censorship
And a pure soul is right before you
First of all I sincerely confess to you
I often regret your fate
A sworn interpreter of human nonsense
Khvostova Bunina's only reader
You are forever obliged to take stock of your sins
Sometimes stupid prose sometimes stupid poetry
Russian authors are alarmed by the difficult situation
Who will translate an English novel from French
He will compose an ode sweating and groaning
Another tragedy will be written for us in jest
We don't care about them but you read and get mad
Yawn a hundred times fall asleep and then sign up
So the censor martyr sometimes wants to
Refresh your mind with reading Rousseau Voltaire Buffon
Derzhavin Karamzin beckon his desires
And I must devote fruitless attention
On some liar's new nonsense
Who has leisure to sing groves and fields
Yes the connection is lost in them look for it from the beginning
Or erase it from the skinny magazine
Rough ridicule and foul language
The courteous wits' intricate tribute
But the censor is a citizen and his rank is sacred
He must have a direct and enlightened mind
He is accustomed to honoring the altar and the throne with his heart
But he does not oppress opinions and tolerates reason
Guardian of the peace decency and morals
He does not transgress the rules he has laid down himself
Loyal to the law loving the fatherland
He knows how to take responsibility upon himself
Does not block the path of useful Truth
Living poetry does not interfere with frolicking
He is a friend of the writer and is not cowardly before the nobility
Prudent firm free fair
And you are a fool and a coward what are you doing to us
Where you should be thinking you blink your eyes
Without understanding us you tarnish and rip us off
You call white black on a whim
Satire libel poetry debauchery
The voice of truth by the rebellion of Kunitsyn Marat
I decided and then go and ask for it from you
Tell me aren't you ashamed that in Holy Rus'
Thanks to you we don't see books until now
And if we talk about it they will think about it
Then loving Russian glory and common sense
The sovereign himself orders to print without you
We are left with the verses of the poem trioleta
Ballads fables elegies couplets
Leisure and love innocent dreams
Flowers of the minute imagination
O barbarian who among us is the owner of the Russian lyre
I did not curse your deadly axe
You wander among the Muses like a tiresome eunuch
Neither ardent feelings nor brilliance of mind nor taste
Not a syllable of the singer of the Piros so pure and noble
Nothing touches your cold soul
You cast a sideways unfaithful glance at everything
Suspecting everything you see poison in everything
Leave the work which is not at all commendable
Parnassus is not a monastery and not a sad harem
And the right is never a skilled farrier
He did not deprive Pegasus of excessive ardor
What are you afraid of believe me whose fun
To ridicule the law government or morals
He will not be subject to your punishment
That one is not familiar to you we know why
And his manuscript does not perish in Lethe
Without your signature he walks around in the world
Barkov didn't send you any humorous odes
Radishchev the enemy of censorship escaped slavery
And Pushkin's poems were never published
That their needs are already different they read
But you carry yours into our wise age
It's unlikely that Shalikov is not a harmful person
Why are you tormenting yourself and us for no reason
Tell me have you read Catherine's Instruction
Read it understand it and you will see it clearly
Your duty your rights you will go another way
In the eyes of the monarch the satirist is excellent
Ignorance was executed in a folk comedy
Even in the narrow head of a court fool
Kuteikin and Christ are two equal persons
Derzhavin is the scourge of nobles at the sound of a formidable lyre
Their proud idols exposed them
Khemnitzer spoke the truth with a smile
Dushenka's confidant joked ambiguously
Cyprida sometimes appeared without a veil
And none of them were bothered by censorship
You're frowning admit it these days
They wouldn't have dealt with you so easily
Who is to blame for this mirror in front of you
The wonderful beginning of Alexander's days
Find out what the seal did in those days
In the field of the mind we cannot retreat
We are righteously ashamed of ancient stupidity
Will we really turn to those years again
When no one dared to call the Fatherland
And both people and the seal crawled in slavery
No no it has passed the destructive time
When Russia bore the burden of Ignorance
Where the glorious Karamzin won his crown
There a fool can no longer be a censor
Correct yourself be smarter and make peace with us
Whatever you say is true I won't argue with you
But can a censor judge in good conscience
I have to spare this and that
Of course you find it funny but I often cry
I read and cross myself I smear it for good luck
There is a fashion for everything taste used to be for example
We hold in great honor Bentham Rousseau Voltaire
And now Milot has fallen into our nets
I am a poor man and I have a wife and children
Wife and children are each other believe me a great evil
All the bad things that happened to us are from them
But there is nothing to do if it is impossible
You should quickly get home carefully
And with your service you are needed by the king
At least get yourself a smart secretary
In a language you don't understand
I write farewell poems
But in a pleasant delusion
I ask for your attention
My friend until I fade away
In separation the feeling is lost
I will never stop idolizing you
You my friend only you
Looking at alien features
Trust only my heart
As before I believed him
Not understanding his passions
Confidant of the Magical Antiquity
Friend of playful and sad fictions
I knew you in the days of my spring
In the days of joys and primordial dreams
I waited for you in the evening silence
You were a cheerful old lady
And she sat above me in the shushun
With big glasses and a frisky rattle
You rock the baby's cradle
My young ears were captivated by the melodies
And between the swaddling clothes she left the flute
Which she herself bewitched
Infancy passed like a light sleep
You loved the carefree youth
Among the important Muses he remembered only you
And you visited him quietly
But was your image the same your attire
How cute you are how quickly you changed
What a fire the smile was revived with
What a fire flashed in the welcoming gaze
The shroud swirling like a disobedient wave
Your half-airy figure barely overshadowed
All in curls entwined with a wreath
The head of the beauty was fragrant
The chest is white under yellow pearls
She blushed and trembled quietly
When amidst the orgies of noisy life
I was ostracized
I saw a mad crowd
Contemptible timid egoism
I left without tears with annoyance
The wreaths of feasts and the splendor of Athens
But your voice was a joy to me
Generous Citizen
Let Fate decide
Terrible persecutions come to me again
Even though friendship has betrayed me
How love cheated on me
In my exile I will forget
The injustice of their grievances
They are insignificant if I
Aristide is justified by you
Recently I was in my free hours
I read the rider's charter
And even clearly understood
His clever arguments
I recognized the sharp features
Inimitable syllable
But he turned the pages
And I confess I grumbled at God
I thought he was a flighty singer
Do not make yourself an idol
I finally got over it
Your naughty lyre
And my heart has grown cold forever
You apparently became the world's servant
A prudent man
I spoke of grief through tears
Who gave Davydov advice
Leave the laurel leave the roses
How could he stoop to prose
The poet crowned by the Muse
Having despised the glory of past years
And the threat of Burtsova's soul
And suddenly a disheveled shadow
I see it right in front of me
Drunk as if it were my death's day
A column of whiskey a mountain of whiskey
Cruel mentality behind your back
And the shako is a miracle at an angle
Play Adele
Know no sorrow
Harita Lel
You were married
And the cradle
Yours was rocked
Your spring
Quiet and clear
For enjoyment
You are born
Hour of rapture
Catch catch
Young years
Give to love
And in the noise of light
Love Adele
My flute
I'm sitting behind bars in a damp dungeon
A young eagle raised in captivity
My sad comrade flapping his wing
Pecks at bloody food under the window
Pecks and throws and looks out the window
As if he had the same idea as me
He calls me with his gaze and his cry
And he wants to say Let's fly away
We are free birds it's time brother it's time
There where the mountain whitens behind the clouds
Where the sea edges turn blue
Where only the wind and I walk
Winter is a loose wall for me
Blocked the way to the gate
While the paths are in front of you
I won't trample through it somehow
I'm sitting at home like a bum
But you are the soul of my soul
Find out what will happen on Monday
What will our Bartholomew say
In a foreign land I observe sacredly
Native custom of olden times
I release the bird into the wild
On the bright holiday of spring
I became available for consolation
Why should I complain to God
When at least one creation
I could give freedom
My dear brother you parted with me as a child
The slow years passed in separation
Now you are a young man and full of soul
You bloom for joy for light for freedom
What a field is open before you
How many delights and pleasures there are for you
And sweet worries and sweet delusions
How often does a new heat excite your blood
You try your heart in hasty hope
You call trusting them both friendship and love
Where are you going outside the city of course
Breathe in the morning marshmallows
And to dream with your Muse
Secluded and carefree
No I'm going to the market
I love the excitement of the market
Skufi Jews mustache Bulgarians
And there is a dispute and a shout and the heat of bargaining
The colorful embarrassment of outfits
I love the crowd rags noise
And the free barking of the greedy rabble
So observe your mind
And here he delves into the spirit of the people
I would be glad to accompany you
To hear your comments
But duty calls me
Sorry we have no time for partying
Where to
We are going to prison today
Escorting you out of prison
Beyond the Moldovan border
Kirdzhali
Listen Helios ringing with your silver bow
Hear the prayer of the Claros elder God he will perish
Now if you do not become a blind guide
The blind man sat down on the stone tired but then
Three shepherds behind him are the children of that deserted country
Soon the barking of the dogs brought their herds of guards running
Having calmed their rage they protected the old man's impotence
From afar they listened to him and approached him and thought: Who is it
This white-headed old man lonely and blind is he not a god
Proud and high hangs on the poor belt simple
The lyre and his voice disturb the waves and the sky
Here he heard the steps he bowed his ear already embarrassed
The unfortunate wanderer stretched out his hands in prayer Do not be afraid
If only it is not hidden in an earthly and decrepit body
God patron of Greece such a majestic charm
Your old age will decorate you they told the stranger
If you are mortal then know that the waves brought you here
To friendly people
Neither the brilliance of the mind nor the grace of the dress
They can't charm you
Only cousins
We learned the secret to captivate you
You have deprived me of peace
But you don't love me
My only hope is Zoya
I'll get married and be your relative
Keeper of sweet feelings and past pleasures
Oh you are a long-familiar Genius to the singer of oak groves
Draw a memory before me
Magical places where I live with my soul
The forests where I loved where the feeling developed
Where infancy merged with early youth
And where nurtured by nature and dreams
I knew poetry joy and peace
Let another sing about heroes and war
I have come to modestly love living silence
And alien to the phantom of brilliant glory
The beautiful oak groves of Tsarskoe Selo are yours
From now on the friend dedicated himself to the unknown Muse
And peaceful songs and sweet leisure
Lead me lead me under the linden canopy
Always dear to my free laziness
To the shore of the lake on the quiet slope of the hills
May I see again the carpets of dense meadows
And a decrepit bunch of trees and a bright valley
And the familiar picture of the wicked shores
And in the quiet lake among the glittering swells
A proud village of calm swans
I'm at home this morning
And I'm waiting for you my dear
Come to me for a glass of rum
Come and let's shake off the old days
Our friend Tardif is Coma's favorite
The cook is a full general
Worthy of friendship and praise
The prudes of the poet joker
Tardif which Caulaincourt
And he fed and robbed
Tardif chased by police
For unpaid debts
Tardif is inexhaustible in mind
Your grandfather is a tailor your uncle is a cook
And you you are a fashionable gentleman
This is what people say about you
And diva no you are not the only one
To the descendant of noble ancestors
Alas no one in my family
He doesn't sew me fashionable tailcoats for free
And he doesn't cook dinner for me
Who stopped you waves
Who has fettered your mighty run
Who in the silent and dense pond
The rebellious stream turned
Whose magic wand struck
In me there is hope sorrow and joy
And a stormy soul
Lulled by the drowsiness of laziness
Let the winds rouse the waters
Destroy the deadly stronghold
Where are you thunderstorm symbol of freedom
Ride over the captive waters
My voice is both gentle and languid for you
The late silence of the dark night is disturbing
Near my bed there is a sad candle
My poems burn merging and babbling
Streams of love flow flow full of you
In the darkness your eyes shine before me
They smile at me and I hear sounds
My friend my gentle friend love your your
I envy you brave pet of the sea
Under the shadow of sails and in storms gray-haired
How long ago did you reach the calm harbor
How long ago did you taste the joyful moment of silence
And again the tempting waves call you
Give your hand to our hearts filled with one passion
For the distant sky for distant countries
Let's leave the shores of Europe dilapidated
I am looking for other elements of the earth a tired inhabitant
Greetings to you free Ocean
The Cursed City of Chisinau
My tongue will get tired of scolding you
Someday on the sinful roof
Your dirty houses
The thunder from heaven will certainly strike
And I won't find any traces of you
They will fall and perish in flames
And the colorful house of Bartholomew
And the dirty shops of the Jews
So if you believe Moses
Unlucky Sodom perished
But with this lovely town
I don't dare compare Kishinev
I am too familiar with the Bible
And I'm not at all accustomed to flattery
Sodom you know was great
Not just a polite sin
But enlightenment through feasts
Hospitable houses
And the beauty of not strict maidens
What a pity that with early thunder
He was struck down by Jehovah's wrath
In the brilliant debauchery of the world
A man protected by God
And a member of the Supreme Council
I would spend my life humbly
In the Paris of the Old Testament
But in Chisinau you know yourself
You can't find any nice ladies
Neither a pimp nor a bookseller
I regret your fate
I don't know if they will come to you
In the evening three lovely handsome men
However somehow my friend
As soon as I have some leisure time
I will appear before you
I will be glad to serve you
With verses prose and all my soul
But Vigel have mercy on my ass
My careless ignorance
Lukavydemon was outraged
And he is my existence
He united with his own forever
I began to look at him with my eyes
Life has given me a poor treasure
With his unclear words
My soul was in tune
I looked at the world with a clear gaze
And he was amazed in silence
Did he really seem like that to me
So majestic and beautiful
What a young dreamer
You were looking for what you were striving for in him
Whose soul is ecstatic
He was not ashamed to idolize
And I cast my gaze upon the people
I saw their arrogant low
Cruel windy judges
Fools are always close to the villainy
In front of their fearful crowd
Cruel vanity cold
The voice of noble truth is ridiculous
The experience of centuries is in vain
You are right wise peoples
Why the free cry of freedom
The herds do not need the gift of freedom
They should be cut or trimmed
Their inheritance from generation to generation
A yoke with rattles and a whip
It happened in sweet blindness
I believed in chosen souls
I imagined their secret birth
Pleasing to the heavenly powers
Opinion pointed to them
I barely got close to them
Breathing with sweet infant hope
If only I believed that the soul would never
Having escaped from decay he carries away eternal thoughts
And memory and love are endless in the depths
I swear I would have left this world long ago
I would crush the life of an ugly idol
And flew away to the land of freedom and pleasure
To a country where there is no death where there are no prejudices
Where one thought floats in heavenly purity
But in vain I indulge in a deceptive dream
My mind persists in despising hope
A worthless thing awaits me beyond the grave
Like nothing Neither thought nor first love
I'm scared and I look at life sadly again
And I want to live a long time so that my dear image will be long
It lurked and burned in my sad soul
The terrible hour will come your heavenly eyes
My friend will be covered in the fog of eternal night
Eternal silence will close your lips
You will forever descend into those dark places
Where the cold relics of your great-grandfathers rest
But I am still your joyless admirer
I will follow you into the sorrowful abode
And I will sit near you sad and mute
At your lovely feet I put them on my knees
I'll put it away and wait sadly but why
So that by the power of my dreams
Vespers have long since passed
But in the cells it is quiet and dark
The abbot himself is already strict
He stopped his prayers
And bowed his old bones
Cross yourself on the bed of the poor
There is sleep and silence all around
But the church's door is open
The lamp's beam trembles
And it dimly illuminates
And the dark painting of icons
And gilded salaries
And it resounds in the silence
Now a heavy sigh now an important whisper
And gloomily slumbers in the heights
The ancient vault is dull and damp
There is a monk standing behind the choir
And the sinner is both motionless
And whispered like a voice from the grave
And the sinner is pale as a corpse
Monk
Unhappy stop it completely
A terrible confession of a villain
Tribute paid by you
To the one who is furious in revenge
The wicked one watches over the sinner
And leads to eternal death
Resign yourself come to your senses time time

I will absolve you of your sins
Lay down the painful burden
In those days when I was new
All impressions of being
And the glances of the maidens and the noise of the oak grove
And at night the singing of the nightingale
When elevated feelings
Freedom glory and love
And inspired arts
The blood was so excited
Hours of hopes and pleasures
With sudden melancholy autumn
Then some evil genius
He began to visit me secretly
Our meetings were sad
His smile his wonderful look
His caustic speeches
They poured cold poison into the soul
With inexhaustible slander
He tempted providence
He called the beautiful a dream
He despised inspiration
He did not believe in love and freedom
He looked at life with mockery
And nothing in all of nature
He didn't want to bless
Will you forgive me for my jealous dreams
My love is a crazy excitement
You are faithful to me why do you love me
Always scare my imagination
Surrounded by a crowd of fans
Why do you want to seem nice to everyone
And gives everyone empty hope
Your wonderful gaze is sometimes tender and sometimes sad
Having taken possession of me my mind was clouded
I am sure of my unhappy love
Don't you see when in the crowd of their passionate
Conversations are alien to one and silent
I am tormented by lonely annoyance
Not a word to me not a look from my cruel friend
Do I want to run with fear and pleading
Your eyes don't follow me
Does another beauty turn you on
Ambiguous conversation with me
You are calm your cheerful reproach
I am deadened by not expressing love
Tell me again my eternal rival
Finding me alone with you
Why does he greet you slyly
Well what does he tell you What right does he have
He should turn pale and become jealous
At the immodest hour between evening and daylight
Without a mother one half-dressed
Why should you take it
But I am loved Alone with me
You are so tender your kisses
So fiery are the words of your love
So sincerely filled with your soul
My suffering seems funny to you
But I love you I understand
My dear friend don't torment me I beg you
You don't know how much I love you
You don't know how much I suffer
Freedom's sower in the desert
I left early before the star
With a pure and innocent hand
Into the enslaved reins
Threw life-giving seed
But I only lost time
Good thoughts and works
Graze peaceful peoples
The call of honor will not awaken you
Why do the herds need the gifts of freedom
They should be cut or trimmed
Their inheritance from generation to generation
A yoke with rattles and a whip
I have had memories of her for a long time
I carry it in the depths of my heart
Her momentary attention
It was a joy to me for a long time
I repeated the verse enchanted
My poem of despondency is a living sound
So sweetly repeated by her
Noticed by her soul
Again to the lyre of tears and secret torment
She listened with sympathy
And now I have passed it on to her
Its captivating sounds
Enough in my pride
I will think with tenderness
I owed my fame to her
And maybe even inspiration
How wayward our heart is
languishing again
I begged you recently
Cheating on my love
With feigned tenderness and sympathy
Enliven your wondrous gaze
Play with my submissive soul
Pour fire and poison into it
You agreed with wet bliss
Your languid gaze was filled
You look thoughtful and important
Your lustful talk
And what you allow tenderly
And what you forbid me
Everything was inevitably impressed
In the depths of my heart
Even though the burden is heavy at times
The cart is light on the move
The dashing coachman of the gray time
Vezet never leaves the box
In the morning we get into the cart
We are happy to rack our brains
And despising laziness and bliss
Let's go scream
But at midday there is no longer that courage
Shocked us worse
And hillsides and ravines
Let's shout more softly fools
The cart continues to roll
By evening we got used to it
And we drive dozing to our overnight stay
And time drives the horses
The motionless guard dozed on the royal threshold
The Lord of the North is alone in his palace
Silently watched and the lots of the earth
In the crowned head the cramped lay
They fell out in succession
And they brought quiet bondage to the world as a gift
And the Lord himself marveled at his work
He thought this was good and his gaze darted
From the Tiber ramparts to the Vistula and Neva
From Sarsko-Relskie linden trees to the towers of Gibraltar
Everything silently awaits the blow
All fell under the yoke all heads bowed
It is finished he said How long ago did the peoples of the world
The fall was glorified by the Great Idol
How long has decrepit Europe been raging
Germany was seething with new hope
Austria was tottering Naples was rebelling
Beyond the Pyrenees has the fate of the people long been
Freedom rules
And only the north hid the autocracy
How long ago and where are you the creators of Freedom
Well go ahead and rhetoric and seek the rights of Nature
Wise men excite the mad crowd
Here is Caesar where is Brutus O formidable orators
Kiss the rod of Russia
And the iron foot that trampled you
He spoke and a certain spirit blew invisibly
It blew and died down and blew past again
The Lord of the North was instantly gripped by a cold
He gazed with confusion at the royal threshold
The stroke of midnight sounded
And behold a sudden guest appeared in the king’s palace
It was this wonderful man the messenger of providence
The Executor of the Fatal Unknown Command
This is the horseman before whom the kings bowed
The heir and murderer of Rebellious Liberty
This cold bloodsucker
This king disappeared like a dream like a shadow of dawn
Neither fat idleness nor lazy wrinkles
Neither the heavy gait nor the early gray hair
Nor the pale flame of frowning eyes
They did not expose him as an exiled hero
The torment of peace
In the seas executed by the kings' will
No his wonderful gaze is alive elusive
Now lost in the distance now suddenly irresistible
How the battle thunderbolt flashed like lightning
In the color of health and courage and power
To the Lord of Midnight
The threatening ruler of the West was coming
This is what he was like when he was on the plains of Austerlitz
His right hand drove away the northern troops
And the Russian fled for the first time before death
This is what he was like when he signed the winning treaty
With peace and with shame
He stood before the young king in Tilsit
No my fat Aristip
Although I love your conversations
Your sweet disposition your sweet wheeze
Your taste and fatty lunches
But I can't swim with you
To the shores of midday Taurida
Please don't forget me
Favorite of Bacchus and Cypris
When the consumptive father
A bit of a skinny Aeneid
Finally set out to sea
Horace is a clever flatterer to him
Sent a solemn ode
Where is the August singer to my friend
Promised good weather
But I don’t write flattering odes
You are not consumptive thank God
I ask you from the sky
Just an appetite for the road
Why were you sent and who sent you
What good or evil were you faithful to do
Why did it go out why did it shine
The earth's wonderful visitor
The scribes spoke the kings were worried
The crowd in front of them was agitated
The exposed altars were empty
The storm of freedom was rising
And suddenly it came down They fell into dust and blood
The ancient tablets were broken
The Husband of Fates appeared the slaves fell silent again
Swords and chains began to ring out
And proud and naked came Debauchery
And the front hearts froze
For the sake of power the Fatherland was forgotten
Brother sold his brother for gold
The madmen said there is no freedom
And the people believed them
And indifferent in their speeches
Good and evil all became a shadow
Everything was consigned to contempt
As the dust of the earth is given over to the wind
The handsome seaman with wings
I call you swim swim
And keep the priceless pledge
Prayers of hope and love
You are the wind with your morning breath
Happy sail tighten up
You are swaying
Don't tire her breasts
O gods of peace fields oak groves and mountains
My Apollo loves your conversation
Among you I found a young Muse
The innocent and simple friend of my days
But somehow it's cute isn't it friends
And my wayward sorceress
Like a quiet breeze or a golden bee
Or a fleeting kiss flying back and forth
The waves of Phlegethon splash
The vaults of Tartarus tremble
Horses of Pale Pluto
Quickly to the nymphs of Pelion
Along the deserted bay
Proserpina followed him
Indifferent and jealous
It flowed one way
Knee before the goddess
The young man bowed timidly
Even goddesses are flattered by betrayal
Proserpine is dear to mortals
Ada the proud queen
He calls the young man with his gaze
The chariot also embraced
They are already being carried to Hades
They rush dressed as a cloud
They see eternal meadows
Elysium and languid Lethe
Sleeping Shores
There is immortality there is oblivion
There is no end to the pleasures there
Proserpine in rapture
Without purple and crown
Obeys desires
Gives him over to kisses
Hidden Beauties
Drowning in voluptuous bliss
And he is silent and groans languidly
But the clock of love is running
The waves of Phlegethon splash
The vaults of Tartarus tremble
Horses of Pale Pluto
They rush him back quickly
And Kerera's daughter leaves
And a lucky man for yourself
From elision leads out
Secret path
And the lucky one unlocks
With a careful hand
The door flies out from
A false swarm of dreams
Hello Wolf my friend
Come here in winter
Yes Yazykov the poet
Bring me with you
Go for a horse ride sometimes
Shoot a pistol
Lyon is my curly brother
Not Mikhailovsky's clerk
He will bring us the right treasure
That there's a box full of bottles
Let's have a drink and keep quiet
The Miracle Life of an Anchorite
In Troegorsk until night
And in Mikhailovskoye until dawn
Days of love are dedicated
Glasses reign at night
We are dead drunk
Then dead in love
Sweet union from ancient times
Poets are connected with each other
They are priests of the same muses
The same flame excites them
Aliens of fate
They are related in inspiration
I swear by Ovid's shadow
I am close to you in languages
I should have gone to the Dorpat road long ago
I went out in the morning
And to the favorable threshold
I carried my heavy staff
And he would return revived
A picture of carefree days
A free-spirited conversation
And with your sonorous lyre
But happiness plays with me maliciously
I've been running around without a roof over my head for a long time
Where will autocracy blow
Having fallen asleep I don’t know where I’ll wake up
We are always driven into exile now
I drag out my days in chains
Hear my calling poet
Don't let my hopes be deceived
In the village where Petra is a pet
The kings' favorite slave of queens
And their forgotten housemate
My great-grandfather Arap was in hiding
Where Elizabeth was forgotten
And the courtyard and the magnificent vows
Under the shade of linden alleys
He thought in the cool years
About my distant Africa
I'm waiting for you You are with me
Will hug in a village hut
My brother by blood by soul
The naughty boy you noticed
And the exalted prophet of the Muses
Our Delvig will leave everything for us
And our trinity will glorify
The Dark Corner of Exile
We will deceive the guards
Let us praise the gifts of liberty
And our wild youth
Let's awaken the noisy feasts
Let us bow our unanimous attention
To the sound of glasses and poems
And the boredom of winter evenings
We'll drive them away with wine and songs
Bookseller
Poems are just fun for you
You should sit down for a bit
The fame has already spread
The most pleasant news everywhere
They say the poem is ready
The fruit of new mental endeavors
So decide I'm waiting for the word
Set your own price for it
Poems of the favorite of muses and graces
We will replace it with rubles in a moment
And into a bunch of cash banknotes
We will turn your leaves
What did you sigh so deeply about
Is it possible to find out
Poet
I was far away
I remembered that time
When rich in hopes
I wrote as a carefree poet
From inspiration not from payment
I saw the rock shelters again
And the dark shelter of solitude
Where am I at the feast of imagination
Sometimes I called upon the muse
My voice sounded sweeter there
There are bright visions there
With indescribable beauty
They were circling and flying above me
In the hours of night inspiration
Everything excited the tender mind
Blooming meadow moon shine
There is a noise of an ancient storm in the chapel
The Old Ladies' Wonderful Legend
Some demon possessed
My leisure time games
He followed me everywhere
He whispered wonderful sounds to me
And with a grave fiery illness
My chapter was full
In her wonderful dreams were born
Into slender sizes flocked
My obedient words
And they closed with a ringing rhyme
In harmony my rival
There was the noise of the forests or a violent whirlwind
Or the living song of the oriole
Or the dull roar of the sea at night
Or the whisper of a quiet river
Then in the silence of labors
I wasn't ready to share
With the crowd's fiery delight
And the muses of sweet gifts
Didn't humiliate me with shameful bargaining
I was the keeper of their stingy
So exactly in silent pride
From the eyes of the hypocritical mob
Gifts from a young mistress
The superstitious lover keeps
Bookseller
But fame has replaced you
Dreams of secret joy
You went your separate ways
Meanwhile the dusty masses
Stale prose and poetry
They wait in vain for readers
And her windy reward
Poet
Blessed is he who kept it to himself
Souls are lofty creations
And from people as from graves
I didn't expect any reward for the feeling
Blessed is he who was a silent poet
And not entwined with the thorns of glory
Forgotten by the despised rabble
Left the world without a name
Hope is more deceptive than dreams
What is glory the whisper of a reader
Is it persecution of the base ignoramus
Or the admiration of a fool
Bookseller
Lord Byron was of the same opinion
Zhukovsky said the same thing
But the world found out and bought it up
Their sweet-sounding creations
And your destiny is truly enviable
The poet executes the poet crowns
The villains with the thunder of eternal arrows
It affects distant descendants
He consoles the heroes
With Corinna on the Cythera throne
He exalts his mistress
Praise for you is a tiresome ringing
But the heart of a woman asks for glory
For them write to their ears
The flattery of Anacreon is pleasant
In our youth roses are ours
More precious than the laurels of Helicon
Poet
Selfish dreams
The joys of mad youth
And I am in the midst of the noisy storm of life
I was looking for the attention of beauty
The lovely eyes read
Me with a smile of love
The magic lips whispered
My sweet sounds to me
But it's enough to sacrifice freedom to them
The dreamer will not bring it
Let their young man sing
Nature's darling
What do I care about them now in the wilderness
Silently my life rushes by
The groan of the faithful lyre will not touch
Their light windy soul
Their imagination is not pure
It doesn't understand us
And the sign of God is inspiration
It's both alien and funny to them
When I can't help but remember
The verse they inspired will come
My heart is so painfully ablaze
I am ashamed of my idols
What did I the unfortunate one strive for
Before whom did the proud mind humble itself
Whom with the delight of pure thoughts
He was not ashamed to idolize
Bookseller
I love your anger Such is the poet
The reasons for your disappointments
I'm not allowed to know but there are exceptions
For lovely ladies really
Isn't there a single one worth it
No inspiration no passion
And your songs will not be appropriated
To his all-powerful beauty
You keep quiet
Poet
Why does a poet need
To disturb the heart with a heavy sleep
He torments his memory in vain
So what does the world care
I am a stranger to everyone my soul
Does the image remain unforgettable
Did I know the bliss of love
Are you exhausted by long melancholy
I hid my tears in silence
Where was she whose eyes
How the sky smiled at me
All life is one or two nights
And what about the tiresome moan of love
The words will seem mine
The madman with wild babble
There their hearts will understand one thing
And then with a sad shudder
It's fate that way
Ah the thought of that withered soul
Could revive youth
And dreams of past poetry
To stir up the crowd again
She alone would understand
My unclear poems
One would burn in the heart
Lamp of pure love
Alas vain desires
She rejected the spells
Prayers for the longing of my soul
Outpouring of earthly delights
How a deity does not need her
Bookseller
So tired of love
I'm bored with the babble of rumors
You refused in advance
From your inspired lyre
Now leaving the noisy light
And the Muses and the windy fashion
So what will you choose
Poet
Freedom
Bookseller
Excellent here's some advice for you
Listen to the truly useful
Our age is a merchant in this iron age
Without money there is no freedom
What is Glory Bright patch
On the singer's tattered rags
We need gold gold gold
Save gold until the end
I anticipate your objection
But I know you gentlemen
Your creation is dear to you
While on the flame of Labor
The imagination is boiling and seething
It will freeze and then
You are sick of writing too
Let me just tell you
Inspiration is not for sale
But you can sell the manuscript
Why wait they're already coming to see me
Impatient Readers
Journalists are wandering around the bench
Behind them are skinny singers
Who asks for food for satire
Some for the soul some for the pen
And I confess from your lyre
I foresee a lot of good
Poet
You are absolutely right Here is my manuscript
Let's agree
Farewell free element
The last time in front of me
You roll blue waves
And you shine with proud beauty
Like a friend's mournful murmur
As he calls at the farewell hour
Your sad noise your inviting noise
I heard it for the last time
The desired limit of my soul
How often along your shores
I wandered quietly and foggily
We are tormented by a cherished intention
How I loved your reviews
The muffled sounds of the abyss are the voice
And silence in the evening hour
And wayward impulses
The humble sail of the fishermen
Protected by your whim
Glides bravely among the swells
But you have risen irresistibly
And the flock of ships sinks
Couldn't leave it forever
I find the motionless shore boring
I congratulate you with delight
And direct it along your ridges
My poetic escape
You waited you called I was chained
My soul was torn in vain
Fascinated by a powerful passion
I remained on the shores
What to regret Where would now
I set out on a carefree path
One item in your desert
My soul would be struck
One rock tomb of glory
There they sank into a cold sleep
Memories are majestic
Napoleon was dying there
There he died amidst torment
And after him like the noise of a storm
Another genius has fled from us
Another ruler of our thoughts
Disappeared mourned by freedom
Leaving the world your crown
Make noise get excited about bad weather
He was your singer about the sea
Your image was marked on it
He was created by your spirit
How powerful deep and dark you are
How indomitable you are
The world is empty Now where to go
You could carry me out to the ocean
The fate of people everywhere is the same
Where there is good there is already guard
Either enlightenment or a tyrant
Farewell sea I will not forget
Your solemn beauty
And I will hear for a long long time
Your hum in the evening hours
In the forests in the deserts are silent
I'll carry you through
Your rocks your bays
And the shine and the shadow and the murmur of the waves
The singer has sung among himself since ancient times
Our tribes are at odds
It is our side that is groaning
Then yours perishes under a thunderstorm
And you used to feast
The Kremlin's disgrace and captivity
And we are on the stones of fallen walls
The infants of Prague were beaten
When they trampled into bloody dust
The beauty of Kosciuszko's banners
And he who is with your maiden is not ours
Connected with a cherished ring
We will not drink from the treasured cup
The health of your red wives
And our young maiden
Having attracted the heart of a Pole
Will reject with pride blazing
Love of the people's enemy
But the voice of wonderful poetry
Enemy hearts become friends
Before the heavenly smile
Earthly hatred is silent
With the sweet sounds of inspiration
At the songs of the lyres
And blessings arise
Peace does not descend upon the tribes
When your friend is at the sound of your speeches
Responds with a sarcastic silence
When he takes his from your hand
As if he were pulling away from a snake with a shudder
How the sharp gaze of a nail looks at you
He shakes his head with disdain
Don't say he's sick he's a child
He is tormented by insane melancholy
Don't say he's ungrateful
He is weak and evil he is not worthy of friendship
His whole life is some kind of heavy dream
Are you really right Are you really calm
Ah if so he is ready to fall into dust
To beg a friend for reconciliation
But if you are the holy power of friendship
Used for malicious persecution
But if you were being intricately sarcastic
His timid imagination
And he found proud amusement
In his melancholy sobs humiliation
But if he himself is a despicable slander
You were an invisible echo to him
But if you put a chain on him
And he betrayed the sleepy enemy with laughter
And he read in your silent soul
All that is secret with his sad gaze
Then go ahead and don't waste your time on empty talk
You are condemned by the final sentence
You published my uncle
The Creator of a Dangerous Neighbor
He was very worthy of it
Although the late Beseda
And didn't notice him
Now publish me buddy
The fruits of my empty labors
But for the sake of Phoebus my Pletnev
When will you be your own publisher
How the Tsar's Arab Planned to Marry
Arap walks among the noblewomen
The blackamoor looks at the young ladies
That the Arab chose his mistress
Black raven white swan
And how is he a black-haired blackamoor
And she is a white soul
Oh rose maiden I am in chains
But I am not ashamed of your shackles
So the nightingale in the laurel bushes
The feathered king of forest singers
Near the proud and beautiful rose
Lives in sweet captivity
And sings tender songs to her
In the darkness of the voluptuous night
You are right when you are so true
He compared it to a living rainbow
You are as sweet as she is to the eyes
And how fickle her soul is
And you are like a rose that has shone in the spring
You are just like her in front of us
Bloom with lush beauty
And you still inject yourself God be with you
But most of all the comparison with the key
I like it I am glad to see him
May you be as pure as he is both in heart and mind
And of course it's colder
Other comparisons are not so good
The poet is not to blame comparisons are not convenient
You have the beauty of your face and the beauty of your soul
Unfortunately they are incomparable
I feel sorry for the great wife
Wives who loved
All kinds of glory are the smoke of war
And the smoke of the Parnassian censer
We are indebted to her
And enlightenment and Taurida
And the disgrace of the Moon
And we must call it
Her Minerva Aonida
In the alleys of Sarskoe village
She is with Derzhavin and Orlov
She had wise conversations and drank tea
With Deligne sometimes with Barkov
There lived a dear old lady
Nice and a little bit prodigal
Voltaire's first friend was
The order wrote fleets and burned
And she died while boarding the ship
Since then it's been foggy
Russia is a poor state
Your strangled glory
Died with Catherine
I won't regret the roses
Faded with a light spring
I also love the grapes on the vines
In clusters ripened under the mountain
The beauty of my fertile valley
Joy of golden autumn
Oblong and transparent
Like the fingers of a young maiden
Fountain of love fountain of life
I brought you two roses as a gift
I love your incessant talk
And poetic tears
Your silver dust
I am sprinkled with cold dew
Ah flow flow joyful spring
Murmur murmur your story to me
Fountain of love fountain of sadness
And I asked your marble
I read the praises of the country far away
But you kept silent about Maria
The pale luminary of the harem
And here are you already forgotten
Or Maria and Zarema
Only happy dreams
Or just a dream of imagination
In the desert darkness I drew
My minute visions
The soul's unclear ideal
While your husband is you a young beauty
I haven't concluded a deal between the other six yet
Go to the source of graves
And draw spring water
And think my dear
Like a non-return stream
It shines runs and disappears
This is how life's time flies away
I will disappear in the harem
Night marshmallow
Ether flows
It's making noise
Runs
Guadalquivir
Here the golden moon has risen
Quieter listen to the sound of the guitar
Here is a young Spanish woman
Leaning on the balcony
Night marshmallow
Ether flows
It's making noise
Runs
Guadalquivir
Take off your mantilla dear angel
And appear like a bright day
Through the cast iron railings
Put your marvelous leg through
Night marshmallow
Ether flows
It's making noise
Runs
Guadalquivir
The stormy day faded away the gloom of the stormy night
A leaden garment spreads across the sky
Like a ghost behind a pine grove
The moon rose misty
Everything brings a gloomy melancholy to my soul
Far away the moon rises in radiance
There the air is filled with evening warmth
There the sea moves like a luxurious veil
Under the blue skies
Now it's time for her to walk along the mountain
To the shores flooded by the roaring waves
There under the treasured rocks
Now she sits sad and alone
No one cries or yearns in front of her
No one kisses her knees in oblivion
She does not betray herself to anyone's lips
No shoulders no wet lips no snow-white chests
No one is worthy of her heavenly love
Isn't it true that you are the only one crying I am calm
But if
Disdaining even the voices of reproach
And the calls of sweet hopes
I walk in foreign lands the ashes of my homeland
Shake off the road clothes
The sleepy whisper of the heart is silent
Habits of old weak voice
Forgive the unkind limit
Where did I first see the light
Forgive the gloomy canopy
Where my days flowed in silence
Full of passions and laziness
And the souls of pensive dreams
My brother on the dangerous day of separation
All thoughts of the heart are about you
Let's shake hands for the last time
And we will submit to fate
Bless the poet's escape
 
somewhere in the excitement of light
Remember my voice sometimes
He will fall silent under the distant sky
dream
One sad
Will fade away in a foreign land
The desired hour will come
And a benevolent Slav
To my nameless grave
You slandered Saburov
My hussar undertakings
How I walked with Kaverin
He scolded Russia with Molostvov
I read with my Chedayev
How to put all worries aside
I spent a whole year between them
But Zubov didn't seduce me
With your dark ass
Child I don't dare to touch you
Say blessings
You look at me with a peaceful soul
Heavenly angel of consolation
May your days be clear
How clear is your dear gaze now
Among the best lots of the earth
May your lot be beautiful
I swear by even and odd
I swear by the sword and the right battle
I swear by the morning star
I swear by the evening prayer
No I haven't left you
Whom in the shadow of peace
I entered the chapter lovingly
And hid from the vigilant persecution
Wasn't it I who gave you a drink of thirst on the day
You through desert waters
Wasn't it me who gifted your tongue
With mighty power over minds
Take courage and despise deception
Follow the path of truth with courage
Love orphans and my Quran
Preach to the trembling creature
O pure wives of the prophet
You are distinguished from all women
Even the shadow of vice is terrible for you
Under the sweet canopy of silence
Live modestly it befits you
The veil of a celibate virgin
Keep your hearts true
For the legal and bashful
Yes the evil gaze of the wicked
Will not see your face
And you about the guests of Mohammed
Flocking to his supper
Beware of the vanities of the world
To confuse my prophet
In the soaring thoughts of piety
He doesn't like the pompous
And immodest and empty words
Honor his feast with humility
And with a chaste inclination
His young slaves
The prophet frowned in confusion
Hearing the blind man approaching
Vice runs but does not dare
He shows bewilderment
The list is given from the heavenly book
You are not a prophet for the obstinate
Calmly proclaim the Quran
Without forcing the wicked
Why does a man boast
Is it because you were born naked
That he breathes for a short century
What is weak will die as weak was born
Is it for this that God will kill
And he will resurrect him according to his will
What from heaven protects his days
In joy and in sorrow
For giving him fruits
And bread and dates and olives
Blessing his works
And the vineyard and the hill and the field
But the angel will sound his trumpet twice
Thunder from heaven will strike the earth
And brother will run away from brother
And the son will shrink away from his mother
And everyone will flow before God
Disfigured by fear
And the wicked shall fall
Covered in flames and ashes
With you of old O Almighty One
The mighty one thought to compete
Full of mad pride
But you Lord humbled him
You said I give life to the world
I punish the earth with death
My hand is raised to everything
I also said he gives life
And I also punish with death
I am equal with you God
But the boast of vice fell silent
From the word of your anger
I will raise the sun from the east
Raise it from the sunset
The earth is motionless the vaults of the sky
The Creator is supported by you
Let them not fall on dry land and water
And they won't crush us
You lit the sun in the universe
Let it shine on heaven and earth
Like flax watered with oil
The crystal shines in the lamp
Pray to the Creator he is mighty
He rules the wind on a hot day
Sends clouds to the sky
Gives the earth a tree's shade
He is merciful to Mohammed
Opened the shining Quran
Let us also run to the light
And let the fog fall from the eyes
It was not for nothing that you appeared in my dreams
In battle with shaved heads
With bloody swords
In the ditches on the tower on the wall
Hear the joyful cry
O children of the fiery deserts
Lead the young slaves into captivity
Share the spoils of war
You have won glory to you
And a laughing stock for the faint-hearted
They are called to battle
Don't go without believing in the wondrous dreams
Tempted by the spoils of battle
Now in my repentance
They say take us with you
But you say we won't take it
Blessed are those who fall in battle
Now they have entered Eden
And drowned in pleasure
Not poisoned by anything
Rise up fearful one
In your cave
Holy lamp
It burns until the morning
With a prayer of the heart
Prophet of Strike
Sad thoughts
Sly dreams
Pray until the morning
Create humbly
The Book of Heaven
Read until the morning
Trading conscience before pale poverty
Do not scatter your gifts with a calculating hand
Full generosity pleases heaven
On the day of terrible judgment like a fertile field
O prosperous sower
She will reward your efforts a hundredfold
But if you regret the labors of earthly acquisitions
Giving a beggar a meager alms
You squeeze your envious hand
Know all your gifts as a handful of dust
What the heavy rain washes from the stone
The tribute rejected by the Lord will disappear
And the tired traveler grumbled at God
He was tormented by thirst and craved shade
Wandering in the desert for three days and three nights
And eyes weighed down by heat and dust
He drove around with hopeless melancholy
And suddenly he sees a well under a palm tree
And he rushed towards the desert palm tree
And greedily refreshed with a cold stream
The tongue and pupils were burning heavily
And he lay down and fell asleep near his faithful donkey
And many years passed over him
By the will of the Lord of heaven and earth
The hour of awakening has come for the traveler
He gets up and hears an unknown voice
How long ago did you fall into a deep sleep in the desert
And he answers the sun is already high
The morning sky was shining yesterday
In the morning I slept deeply until the morning
But the voice O traveler you slept longer
Look you lay down young and rose as an old man
The palm tree has already rotted away and the well is cold
Dried up and dried up in the waterless desert
Long ago covered by the sands of the steppes
And the bones of your donkey turn white
And the old man instantly overcome with grief
He drooped crying and shaking his head
And then a miracle happened in the desert
The past has come to life in new beauty
The palm tree's shady head sways again
Once again the well is filled with coolness and darkness
And the old bones of the donkey rise up
And they dressed themselves in body and made a roar
And the traveler feels both strength and joy
Resurrected youth played in the blood
Holy raptures filled the chest
And with God he sets off on his journey
Lisa is afraid to fall in love
Isn't there some deception here
Be careful maybe
This is the new Diana
Hidden a tender passion
And with bashful eyes
Searches timidly between you
Who would help her fall
Forgive me Ukrainian sage
Viceroy of Phoebus and Priapus
Your straw hat
More peaceful than any crown
Your Rome village you are my dad
Bless me singer
What will be the wine
Lyon I've been waiting for him for a long time
Do you know what kind
I have one law
Complete freedom of thirst
And tolerance of all kinds of wines
My hospitable cellar
Glad for gold Madeira
And under the resinous cork
In my red summers
In the summers of crazy youth
Poetic Ai
I liked him for his noisy foam
This is the likeness of love
remembered the poet
And a foamy glass
I then to everything in the world
Dear brother preferred
Now there is no passion in me
Indiscriminately at the table
A reasonable friend of lust
I go around wine
I love everything little by little
I move the glass often
I drink often but thank God
Rarely rarely I go to bed drunk
You wither and remain silent sadness consumes you
The smile on the virgin lips dies
For a long time now your needle has been making patterns and flowers
You don't come to life Silently you love
To be sad Oh I am an expert in maiden sadness
My eyes have been reading your soul for a long time
You can't hide love we love you and how we love each other
Tender girls love excites you
Happy are the youths but who can say among them
A handsome young man with blue eyes
With black curls you blush I am silent
But I know everything and if I want
Then I will call him Isn't he the one who wanders forever
Around your house and raises your gaze to the window
You secretly wait for him He comes and you run
And for a long time you look after him invisible
Nobody at the festival of the brilliant May
Flying between luxurious chariots
No young man is freer and bolder
He does not rule the horse at his own whim
Why cold doubts
I believe there was a terrible temple here
Where the bloodthirsty gods
The sacrifices were smoking
Here I was calmed down
The Feud of the Fierce Eumenides
Here is the herald of Taurida
She raised her hand to her brother
It happened on these ruins
The holy celebration of friendship
And the deity of great souls
He became proud of his creation
Chedayev do you remember the past
How long ago with youthful delight
I thought of a fatal name
Consign to ruins to others
But in a heart humbled by storms
Now there is laziness and silence
And in inspired emotion
On the stone consecrated by friendship
I write our names
Why are you a formidable aquilon
The coastal reeds bend down
Why to the distant sky
You drive away the cloud so angrily
Recently a ridge of black clouds
The vault of heaven was covered with a thick cloud
Recently the oak tree over the height
He excelled in his arrogant beauty
But you got up you jumped up
You made a noise with thunder and glory
And dispersed the stormy clouds
And the majestic oak tree fell
Let the sun's clear face
From now on it shines with joy
And the marshmallow plays like a cloud
And the reeds sway quietly
Let him be crowned with the love of beauty
In the treasured gold he keeps her features
And secret letters are the reward of long suffering
But in the quiet hours of agonizing separation
Nothing nothing pleases my eyes
And not a single gift from my beloved
The holy pledge of love is the consolation of tender sadness
Doesn't heal the wounds of crazy hopeless love
On the slippery field of Timkovsky's heir
Let me hug you my former interlocutor
Recently oppressed by heavy censorship
The last miserable rights are deprived without mercy
Persecuted together with all the brethren
I flared up and told you a little big
He amused the abusive itch of insolence
But forgive me I couldn't stand it
Now in my wilderness tearing apart magazines
And parsing the poems of the poor brethren
Now I just want to read and have leisure time
I was delighted to suddenly notice them
You have both rules and a new image of thoughts
Hooray you've earned yourself a laurel wreath
And with firmness of soul and courage of mind
How poetry itself was amazed
When you allowed it by your wonderful grace
The cherished words divine heavenly
And beauty was named for them for the sake of rhyme
Without offending the Lord Christ
But what suddenly changed you
And the arrogance of your character has been pacified
I really love my messages
At least I know that you read my complaint
But having teased you I sow change
I am pleasantly surprised I dare not be proud
I treated you according to my duty
But should I correct you I don’t know who
Russia owes this important news
Having finally thought over good intentions
Our good king has chosen an honest minister
Shishkov has already taken over the reign of sciences
This elder is dear to us a friend of honor a friend of the people
He is famous for the glory of the twelfth year
Alone in a crowd of nobles he loved the Russian muses
He called them together unnoticed
Catherine's Orphaned Crown
From the cold of our days he sheltered the only laurel
He lamented with us when the holy father
Taking Omar da Gali as a model
To please the Lord and to console myself
He tried hard to strangle enlightenment
Pious humble soul
Karala of pure muses saving Bantysh
And the noble Magnitsky helped him
A man who is firm in his rules and excellent in his soul
And even my poor fool Kavelin
The baptizer of Galich Magnitsky the deacon
And now for all the sins into whose vile hands
You were entrusted with sad sciences
Censorship is who you were subject to
But the dark time has passed completely
And the lamp of enlightenment burns brighter
I am with the change of the unfortunate government
I confess I expected the censors to resign
But without knowing how you apparently resisted
So I hurried to congratulate my friends
Meanwhile leave them some advice as a keepsake
Be strict but be smart They don't ask you
To destroy all legal barriers
All think speak type safely
You allowed our masters to act arbitrarily
Keep your rights as you deserve
But to the humble Truth and the peaceful Mind
And even the stupidity of innocence and contentment
Do not block the way with a willful outpost
And if you are in the fruits of an idle pen
Sometimes you can't find great good
When you don't see the crazy debauchery in them
Thrones altars and morals of the enemy
I wish the author glory with all my heart
Wave your hand my friend and sign boldly
O Muse of fiery satire
Come to my calling call
I don't need a thundering lyre
Hand me the scourge of Juvenal
Not to the cold imitators
Not for hungry translators
Not to the unresponsive rhymers
I am preparing epigrammatic ulcers
Peace be with you unfortunate poets
 
 
Peace be with you magazine minions
Peace be upon you humble fools
And you guys are scoundrels
Forward I will slaughter all your bastards
I am tormented by the punishment of shame
But what if I forget someone
Please remind me gentlemen
Oh how many shamelessly pale faces
Oh how many broad copper foreheads
Are you ready to accept from me
An indelible mark
Raised to the beat of a drum
Our king was a dashing captain
He fled at Austerlitz
In the twelfth year I was trembling
But there was a dashing professor
But the hero got tired of the front
Now he is a collegiate assessor
In terms of foreign affairs
Goodbye letter of love goodbye she said
How long have I hesitated how long have I not wanted
Hand to burn all my joys
But the hour has come to burn the letter of love
I am ready my soul does not listen to anything
The greedy flame already accepts your leaves
A minute later a light smoke flared up and blazed
Waving I get lost with my prayer
The loss of a faithful ring is an impression
The melted sealing wax boils Oh providence
It has happened The dark sheets have curled up
On the light ashes their cherished features
My chest is turning white My dear ashes are embarrassed
A poor consolation in my sad fate
Stay forever with me on my sorrowful chest
Your neighborhood is dangerous for us
At least it might be cute
I say this for a reason
And it's not hard to prove
Your home is a polite conversation
And jokes mixed with bile
They remind us vividly
And indeed a dangerous neighbor
When on the forehead of the feasting on Delia's beautiful breast
The dazzling rose has ended its life
Suddenly breaking away from its native stem
Like a light sigh her tender soul evaporates
On the shores of Elysium her fragrant shadows
The lifeless shores of Lethe will enchant you
Only roses fade
Breathing ambrosia
Flies away to Elysium
Their light soul
And where the waves are sleepy
Oblivion is carried
Their shadows are fragrant
They bloom over Summer
They once told the king that finally
The rebel leader Riego was strangled
I am very glad said the zealous flatterer
The world is freed from one scoundrel
Everyone fell silent everyone looked down
The quick verdict made everyone laugh
Riego was guilty before Ferdinand
I agree but he was hanged for that
Is it decent to say in the heat of the moment
We should scold the executioner's victim
The sovereign himself is of such goodwill
Didn't want to reward with a smile
Flatterers flatterers try to save
And in meanness the bearing of nobility
My enemies I haven't said a word yet
And it seems my quick anger has died down
But I don't let you out of my sight
And I will choose anyone someday
Will not escape the piercing claws
As I fly unexpectedly merciless
So the greedy hawk circles in the clouds
And guards the turkeys and geese
Tell me what spells
Have power over you
Everyone is good at all callings
I'm ready to fall from the sky
One wish is enough
I am like a smart serf
Clap your hands in Turkish style
Whistle call and instantly
I will appear What to do I serve
I live groaning under the eternal yoke
I walk like a poor nanny
I listen and watch you
Here is Cocytus here is Acheron
Here is the burning Phlegethon
Doctor Faust be brave!
We'll have more fun there
Where is the bridge What bridge is there
Here sit on my tail
Who goes there soldier
What is this Parade
Here is the chief corporal
Non-commissioned general
What burns in the darkness
What's boiling in the cauldron
Faust ha ha ha
Look at the ear
Look kings
Oh vari vari
Today is Satan's ball
We are called on our birthday
Look at these two little devils
They are diligently roasting a pig
And this demon how important he is
How decorously he sweeps out
Sawdust sulfur dust and bones
Tell me if there will be guests soon
So here is the exile of the children of the earth
What order and silence
What a huge row of vaults
But where do they cook sinners
All is quiet There much further away
Where are we now In the grand hall
What a trump card Worms I go
I'm hitting Can't you wait
Beru Krugom beat us
Hey death you really cheated
Shut up you're stupid and young
It's not up to you to catch me
After all we are not playing for money
If only to spend eternity
Who's there Hello gentlemen
Why did you come here
I brought a guest Ah creator
Here is our friend Doctor Faustus
He is alive and ours for a long time
Today or tomorrow it doesn't matter
There are two ways of thinking about this
Custom demanded however
With my permission
But anyway it's nothing
You know I'm always a friend
Ready to provide a service
I am the queen of Cut I hit with the ace
Let me play a trump card Well let's go
I witnessed your golden spring
Then the mind is in vain art is not needed
And the beauty itself is seventeen years old
But time passed and a change came
You are approaching a dubious time
How fewer suitors crowd the yard
And the quieter sound of praise enchants your ears
And the mirror is even more threatening and frightening
What to do console yourself and reconcile yourself
Give up your sweet old rights in advance
Look for other victories and successes before you
I wish you happiness with all my heart
and my experiences
My didactic prudent verse
Believe me when there are horseflies and mosquitoes
There's a swarm of magazines flying around you
Don't argue don't waste polite words
Don't mind the squeak and impudent noise
Neither logic nor taste my dear friend
There is no way to tame their stubborn race
It's a sin to be angry but swing and suddenly
Slam them with a nimble epigram
Europe gasped in vain
Don't be sad it's not a problem
From the St Petersburg flood
The North Star was saved
Bestuzhev your ark on the shore
The heights of Parnassus shine
And in the beneficent ark
Both people and animals were saved
The Sultan is furious Blood of Hellas
And it will jump and boil
Ancient treasures were revealed to the Greeks
The fierce pit trembles in the Styx
And here flies the ship boldly
And the thunder strikes both ways
Se Beiron Phoebe sample
The illness came running but it was fast-paced
Obstinate and ungrateful
He brought death upon him with a chisel
The singer is immortal and venerable
Hellas calls you today
In place of the famous shadow
Before whom Cerberus roars today
How will you be here as a senator
How is the venerable writer here
But a new laurel awaits you there
Where the ground is soaked with blood
Pericles Laurel Laurel of Themistocles
Fly there our Khvostov himself
You and Byron were hissing with anger
The flattery was thunderous and true
He is Lord Earl you are both poets
It seems that there is a clear similarity
No way You are with your faithful wife
Under the burden of an elastic fate
You live in love and finally
It is deep but uniform
And you are deep playful and diverse
And in your pranks you are truly a singer
And I am an unknown Piita
I will sing in new delight
Following Piita is famous
I am truthful in my praise
Praying to the running ship
Yes Beyron he will see the bush
And may they guard your peaceful sleep
Neptune Pluto Zeus Cytherea
Hebeya Psyche Kron Astraea
Phoebus Games Laughter Bacchus Charon
How is Kurilka still alive journalist
The little guy alive is still just as dry and boring
And rude and stupid and tormented by envy
He squeezes everything into his useless sheet
And the old nonsense and the nonsense novelty
Ugh I'm tired of the Smoking Room journalist
How to put out a stinky torch
How to kill my Smoking Room
Give me some advice I can't help it
Singer when in front of you
The earthly world was hidden in darkness
Instantly your genius woke up
He looked back on everything that had happened
And in the choir of bright ghosts
He sang wonderful songs
Oh dear brother what sounds
I listen to them in tears of delight
With your heavenly singing
He put to sleep the torments of the earth
He created a new world for you
You can see and fly in it
And again you live and embrace
The idol of youth broken
And I if my only verse
Gave you a moment of joy
I don't want any other reward
No wonder her dark path
I walked through the desert of the world
Oh no it’s not for nothing that life and the lyre
I was entrusted by fate
When intoxicated with love and bliss
Silently kneeling before you
I looked at you and thought you were mine
Do you know my dear did I desire fame
You know removed from the windy light
Bored by the poet's vain title
Tired of long storms I did not pay attention at all
To the distant buzz of reproaches and praises
Could rumors disturb me with sentences
When bending their languid gazes towards me
And quietly laid his hand on my head
You whispered say do you love are you happy
You won't love another one like me tell me
You will never forget me my friend
And I kept an awkward silence
I was filled with pleasure I thought
That there is no future that the terrible day of separation
Will never come And what about the tears of torment
Treason and slander are all against my head
It suddenly collapsed That I am where I stand
Like a traveler struck by lightning in the desert
And everything before me became eclipsed And now
I am tormented by a desire that is new to me
I wish for glory in my name
Your hearing was struck by the constant sound of me
To be surrounded by loud rumors
Everything around you sounded about me
To listen to the faithful voice in silence
You remembered my last prayers
In the garden in the darkness of the night in a moment of separation
Recently I whistled in verse
And he gave them out without my signature
A magazine jester published an article about them
The villain let her go without a signature
But what about me and the marketplace jester
Failed to cover up his mischief
He recognized me by my claws in a minute
I recognized him by his ears
Maybe I won't be around for long
To remain in peaceful exile
Sighing for the dear old days
And to the rural muse in silence
To indulge in a carefree soul
But even in the distance in a foreign land
I will be a constant thought
Wander around Trigorskogo
In the meadows by the river above the hill
In the garden under the shade of domestic linden trees
When the clear day fades
One from the depths of the grave
So sometimes in the native canopy
A yearning shadow flies
Cast a tender glance at your loved ones
Keep me safe my talisman
Keep me in the days of persecution
In days of repentance and excitement
You were given to me on a day of sorrow
When the ocean rises
The waves roar around me
When the clouds come in like thunder
Keep me safe my talisman
In the solitude of foreign lands
In the bosom of boring peace
In the anxiety of a fiery battle
Keep me safe my talisman
Sacred Sweet Deception
The magic light of the soul
It hid and changed
Keep me safe my talisman
Let it be in the age of heart wounds
Will not ruin the memory
Farewell hope sleep desire
Keep me safe my talisman
Meanwhile the astonished world
He looks at Byron's urn
And to the choir of European lyres
Near Dante his shadow listens
Another shadow calls me
It's been a long time since there were songs or tears
From the bloody scaffold in the days of suffering
Descended into the shade of the grave
To the singer of love of oak groves and peace
I bring grave flowers
An unknown lyre sounds
I sing he and you listen to me
The tired ax rose again
And calls for a new victim
The singer is ready the pensive lyre
Sings to him for the last time
Tomorrow the execution is a usual feast for the people
But the lyre of the young singer
What does she sing about She sings about freedom
Hasn't changed completely
I greet you my luminary
I glorified your heavenly face
When he sparked into existence
When you rose in the storm
I praised your sacred thunder
When he tore down the shameful stronghold
And the ancient pride of power
Scattered with ashes and shame
I saw the civil courage of your sons
I heard their brotherly vow
A magnanimous oath
And a fearless response to autocracy
I saw how powerful their waves were
All were overthrown and carried away
And the fiery tribune predicted a full delight
Rebirth of the Earth
Your wise genius has already shone
Already in the immortal Pantheon
The glorious shadows of the holy exiles entered
From the veil of prejudice
The old throne was unveiled
The shackles fell Law
Relying on liberty he proclaimed equality
And we cried out Bliss
Oh woe oh mad dream
Where is freedom and law Above us
The axe alone reigns
We overthrew the kings the murderer with the executioners
We have chosen as kings Oh horror oh shame
But you are sacred freedom
Goddess pure no you are not guilty
In the gusts of violent blindness
In the despicable fury of the people
You have hidden your healing vessel from us
Covered in a bloody veil
But you will come again with vengeance and glory
And again your enemies will fall
The people who once tasted your sanctified nectar
Still looking to get drunk on it again
As if enraged by Bacchus
He wanders around tormented by thirst
So he will find you Under the shade of equality
He will rest sweetly in your arms
So the dark storm will pass
But I will not see you days of glory days of bliss
I am doomed to the chopping block The last hours
I drag the execution tomorrow with a solemn hand
The executioner will lift my head by the hair
Above the indifferent crowd
Forgive me oh friends my homeless ashes
Will not rest in the garden where they saw him off
We are carefree days in science and in feasts
And the location of our urns was designated in advance
But if others are talking about me
Sacred is your memory
Fulfill my last wish
Weep for my dear lot in silence
Beware of arousing suspicion with tears
In our age you know tears are a crime
Brother does not dare to regret his brother now
Another prayer you have heard a hundred times
Poems of fleeting thoughts careless creations
Various cherished legends
All the hopes and dreams of my youth
And tears and love are friends of these sheets
All my life they have been keeping me at Abel's and Fanny's
Please find their innocent muse tribute
Collect Strict Light arrogant rumor
They will not know them Alas my head
My immature genius will fall prematurely
For glory he did not accomplish sublime creations
I will soon die completely but I love my shadow
Keep the manuscript about others for yourself
When the thunderstorm passes by a superstitious crowd
Come and read my faithful scroll sometimes
And after listening for a long time say it was him
Here is his speech And I have forgotten the grave sleep
I will rise invisibly and sit among you
I will listen to your tears myself
I'll get drunk and maybe I'll be consoled
My Prisoner Can Be Love
Sad and pale listening to the poems of love
But the gentle songs are instantly interrupted
The young singer hung his head thoughtfully
It's spring time with his love and longing
The languid eyes of beauties rushed before him
And songs and feasts and fiery nights
Everything came to life together and the heart raced
Far away and the murmur of poetry poured out
Where did the hostile genius lure me
Born for love for peaceful temptations
Why did I leave the shadow of an unknown life
Freedom and friends and sweet laziness
Fate cherished my golden youth
Joy crowned me with a carefree hand
And the pure muse shared my leisure time
At noisy evenings of friends a beloved friend
I sweetly announced with both laughter and poetry
A canopy guarded by the household gods
When tired of bacchic anxiety
And suddenly a new flame flared up
In the morning I finally appeared to the sweet maiden
And found her in confusion and anger
When there are threats and tears in the eyes
My cursed century wasted in feasts
She chased me scolded me and forgave me
How sweetly my life flowed and flowed away
Why from this lazy and simple life
I rushed to where the fatal horror was
Where are the wild passions where are the violent ignoramuses
And malice and self-interest Where are my hopes
You lured me in What was I to do
To me faithful to love poetry and silence
On a low field with despised fighters
Was it up to me to control the unruly horses
And it's cool to strain the powerless reins
And what will I leave behind Forgotten traces
Of mad jealousy and insignificant insolence
Perish my voice and you O false phantom
You are an empty word
Oh no
Silence the cowardly murmur
Be proud and rejoice poet
You have not bowed your head in obedience
Before the shame of our years
You have despised a powerful villain
Your torch is blazing menacingly
A cruel gleam illuminated
Council of the inglorious rulers
Your scourge overtook them and executed them
These executioners of the autocrats
Your verse whistled through their heads
You called them you glorified Nemesis
You sang to the Marat priests
The Dagger and the Eumenides Maiden
When the holy old man tore himself away from the chopping block
The crowned head with a numb hand
You boldly gave them both your hand
And I trembled before you
Areopagus is furious
Be proud be proud singer and you are a fierce beast
Play with my chapter now
She is in your clutches But listen know godless
My cry my furious laughter haunts you
Drink our blood and live destroying
You are still a pygmy a worthless pygmy
And the hour will come and it is already near
You will fall tyrant Indignation
The Fatherland's sobbing will finally rise again
Will awaken the tired rock
Now it's time to go but you follow me
I'm waiting for you
Thus sang the rapturous poet
And everything was at rest the lamps' quiet light
Turned pale before the morning dawn
And the morning blew into the dungeon And the poet
He raised his important gaze to the grate
Suddenly there is noise They came calling There is no hope
The keys locks and bolts sound
They call it Wait Wait a day just one day
And there are no executions and freedom for everyone
And the great citizen lives
Among the great people
They don't hear the silent procession the executioner awaits
But friendship will enchant the poet's mortal path
Here is the chopping block He has ascended He calls glory
Cry muse cry
You promised about romanticism
About this Parnassian atheism
Talk to me some more
Poltava muses to tell secrets
And you write to me about her alone
No that's clear my dear
No you are in love Pyron Ukraine
You are right what could be more important
There are no beautiful women in the world
A smile in her eyes
More precious than gold and honor
More precious than controversial glory
Let's talk about her again
I praise my friend her hunting
Having a rest having children
Like their mother
And happy is he who shares with her
This pleasant care
She won't make you yawn
God grant that only Hymen
Meanwhile he prolonged his slumber
But I don't agree with you
I don't approve of divorce
First of all faith is a sacred duty
Law and nature itself
And secondly I will note
Decent husbands
Smart wives need
They have friends at home
Either barely noticeable or invisible
Believe me my dears
One helps the other
And the sun of marriage is eclipsed
The bashful star of love
I remember a wonderful moment
You appeared before me
Like a fleeting vision
As a genius of pure beauty
In the languor of hopeless sadness
In the worries of noisy bustle
A gentle voice sounded to me for a long time
And I dreamed of sweet features
The years passed the rebellious gust of storms
Dispelled the old dreams
And I forgot your gentle voice
Your heavenly features
In the wilderness in the darkness of confinement
My days dragged on quietly
Without a deity without inspiration
No tears no life no love
The soul has awakened
And here you are again
Like a fleeting vision
As a genius of pure beauty
And the heart beats in rapture
And for him they were resurrected again
Both deity and inspiration
And life and tears and love
The moon shines motionless the sea sleeps
The luxurious gardens of Hassan are silent
But who is sitting there in the darkness of the trees
On the marble of the sad fountain
The Arab eunuch guardian of the harem is gray
And with him is his young comrade
Mizrur is a disease of mental anguish
You can't hide it from me
Your gloomy gaze your angry murmur
Your Fierce Dreams
They told me everything a long time ago
I know life is hard for you
And what is the cause of your sadness
My son listen to the old man
Three days the merchant's daughter
Natasha disappeared
She's out in the yard on the third night
She ran in without memory
Questions father and mother
They started to approach Natasha
Natasha doesn't hear them
Trembling and barely breathing
The mother grieved the father grieved
And it took a long time to get started
And finally they retreated
But they didn't find out the secret
Natasha became as she was
Again the rouge is cheerful
Went with my sisters again
Sit behind the gate
Once at the plank gates
With my girlfriends
The girl was sitting and then
Rushed ahead of them
A dashing troika with a young man
Horses covered with carpet
In the sleigh he drives standing up
And he drives everyone and crushes them
He leveled up and looked
Natasha looked
He flew past like a whirlwind
Natasha died
She runs headlong home
He he found out says
He's definitely the one holding it
My friends save me
The family listens sadly
Shaking his head
Father to her My dear
Open yourself to me
Tell me who offended you
Just show us the trail
Natasha is crying again
And not another word
The next morning the matchmaker came to their yard
The unexpected comes
Natasha is praised by the conversation
She starts it with her father
You have goods we have a merchant
The guy is a fine fellow
Both stately and agile
Not absurd not shameful
The rich are smart in front of no one
Doesn't bow to the waist
And how is the boyar in the meantime
Lives without worry
And he will suddenly give it to the bride
And a fox fur coat and pearls
And golden rings
And brocade dresses
He saw him riding yesterday
She's outside the gate
Is it possible from the yard
Yes to church with icons
She is sitting at the pie
Yes he speaks indirectly
And the poor bride
He doesn't see a place for himself
I agree says the father
Go safely
My Natasha down the aisle
It's boring to be alone in the room
You can't live as a maid forever
Not everything is for the killer whale to sing
It's time to make a nest
To give peace to the children
Natasha was up against the wall
And he wants to say a word
Suddenly she started crying and shaking
And cries and laughs
The matchmaker runs to her in confusion
Gives cold water to drink
And pours out the rest of the cup
On Natasha's head
The family is collapsing and groaning
Natasha came to her senses
And he says I am obedient
Your holy will be done
Invite the groom to the feast
Bake bread for the whole world
You cook honey to glory
Yes invite the court to a feast
Please Natasha my angel
Ready for your fun
I will give my life and a mountain of feast
They bake and cook to perfection
Here are the honest guests found
The bride was led to the table
The girlfriends sing and cry
And here comes the sleigh jumping
Here comes the groom and everyone is at the table
The glasses are clinking and rattling
The ladle of health went around
All the guests are noisy and drunk
Groom
And what about my dear friends
My red bride
Doesn't drink doesn't eat doesn't serve
What the bride grieves about
The bride to the groom in response
I'll open for luck
There is no peace for my soul
I cry day and night
A bad dream is crushing me
Father to her What does your dream say
Tell us what is it
My dear child
I dreamed she said
I went into a dense forest
And it was late a little moon
Shining from behind the clouds
I lost my way in the wilderness
Not a soul was heard
And only pines and firs
The peaks rustled
And suddenly as if in reality
The hut is in front of me
I knock on her door they call silently
There is no answer to the plea
I opened the door and entered
I see a candle burning in the hut
Silver and gold everywhere
Everything is light and rich
Groom
And how is your dream worse than a fairy tale
Know that you will live richly
Bride
Wait sir it's not finished
From silver to gold
On cloth rugs brocade
On the Novgorod Kamcha
I silently admired
And I was amazed
Suddenly I hear a scream and a horse's stomp
We drove up to the porch
I quickly slammed the door
And hid behind the stove
I hear many voices
Twelve young men came up
And with them the dove
Beautiful maiden
They went up in a crowd without bowing
Not noticing the icons
They sit down at the table without praying
And without taking off their hats
Big brother comes first
The younger brother is rightfully considered
To the left is a pigeon
Beautiful maiden
Shout laughter songs noise and ringing
A riotous hangover
Groom
And what's wrong with your dream
He broadcasts joy
Bride
Wait sir it's not finished
There goes a hangover thunder and ringing
The feast rages merrily
Only the maiden grieves
He sits silently neither eating nor drinking
And the current brings tears
And the elder brother takes his knife
Whistling sharpens
Looks at the beautiful girl
And suddenly he grabs her by the braid
The villain destroys the girl
Her right hand is cut off
Well that's the groom speaking
A complete fiction
But don't be sad your dream is not evil
Believe me my soul is a girl
She looks into his face
And whose hand is this ring from
Suddenly the bride said
And everyone stood up from their seats
The ring rolls and rings
The groom trembles and turns pale
The guests were confused The court says
Hold on to the villain
The villain is chained and exposed
And soon he was executed
Natasha became famous
And here is our whole song
If life deceives you
Don't be sad don't be angry
In the day of despondency humble yourself
Believe me the day of fun will come
The heart lives in the future
The present is depressing
Everything will pass instantly
Whatever happens will be nice
Defenders of the whip and lash
About the famous princes
For everything my wife and children
We are grateful to you as I am
I will pray to God for you
And I will never forget
When they call
I'm in for a full punishment
For your health and glory
I will be the king's first whip
Russian literature is sick
She lies there in hysterics
And raves in the language of dreams
And the cold Zoilus meanwhile
Kachenovsky gave her a cold
Flow of monthly publications
There is a sad moon in the sky
Meets with a cheerful dawn
One is burning the other is cold
The dawn shines like a young bride
The moon before her is as pale as death
So I met you Elvina
Satirist and love poet
Our Aristipus and Asmodeus
You are not Anna Lvovna's nephew
My late aunt
The writer is gentle thin sharp
My uncle is not your uncle
But dear muses are our sisters
So you are still my brother
That the voice of joy has died down
Let the bacchanalian refrains ring out
Long live the gentle maidens
And the young wives who loved us
Fill the glass fuller
To the ringing bottom
Into thick wine
Throw away the treasured rings
Let's raise the glasses and push them together
Long live the muses long live reason
You holy sun burn
How this lamp grows pale
Before the clear sunrise
Thus false wisdom flickers and smolders
Before the immortal sun of the mind
Long live the sun and let the darkness hide
Accept Nevsky Almanac
He is sweet both in prose and in poetry
You will find Polevoy here
Greater Poland Khvostova
The prince is your distant relative
I also decorated this book
But you won't find me
My poems have slipped into oblivion
That the glory of the world is smoke and ashes
Oh your heart is dearer to me
But it seems difficult for me too
Get into this almanac too
Flowers are the last mile
Luxurious firstborns of the fields
They are sad dreams
They awaken more life in us
So sometimes the hour of separation
Livelier than a sweet date
The forest sheds its crimson attire
Frost will silver the withered field
The day will peep through as if against my will
And will disappear beyond the edge of the surrounding mountains
Blaze the fireplace in my deserted cell
And you friend are the wine of autumn cold
Pour a pleasant hangover into my chest
A moment of oblivion of bitter torment
I am sad I have no friend with me
With whom would I drink away a long separation
Whose hand could I shake from the heart
And wish you many happy years
I drink alone in vain imagination
Around me comrades are calling
The familiar approach is not heard
And my soul does not wait for my beloved
I drink alone and on the banks of the Neva
My friends call me today
But how many of you are feasting there
Who else are you missing
Who changed the captivating habit
Whom did the cold light take away from you
Whose voice fell silent at the fraternal roll call
Who didn't come Who is not among you
He didn't come our curly singer
With fire in the eyes and a sweet-voiced guitar
Under the myrtles of beautiful Italy
He sleeps quietly and is a friendly cutter
Didn't write over the Russian grave
A few words in my native language
So that one day the sad one will find a greeting
Son of the North wandering in a foreign land
Are you sitting in a circle of your friends
Restless lover of other skies
Or are you again passing through the sultry tropics
And the eternal ice of the midnight seas
Happy Journey From the Lyceum Threshold
You stepped onto the ship jokingly
And since then your path has been in the seas
O beloved child of waves and storms
You saved in the wandering fate
The original morals of beautiful years
Lyceum noise lyceum fun
Among the stormy waves you dreamed
You extended your hand to us from across the sea
You carried us alone in your young soul
And he repeated: For a long separation
Perhaps a secret fate has condemned us
My friends our union is wonderful
He like the soul is indivisible and eternal
Unwavering free and carefree
He grew together under the shadow of friendly muses
Wherever fate takes us
And happiness wherever it leads
All the same we are the whole world is a foreign land to us
Our Fatherland is Tsarskoe Selo
From edge to edge we are pursued by thunderstorms
Entangled in the web of harsh fate
I tremble at the bosom of new friendship
The charter leaned its caressing head
With my sad and rebellious prayer
With the trusting hope of the first years
I gave myself over to other friends with a tender soul
But their unbrotherly greeting was bitter
And now here in this forgotten wilderness
In the abode of desert blizzards and cold
A sweet joy was prepared for me
Three of you are friends of my soul
Here I embraced the poet's disgraced house
Oh my Pushchin you were the first to visit
You sweetened the sad day of exile
You turned his Lyceum into a day
You Gorchakov are lucky from the first days
Praise be to you the cold shine of fortune
I have not changed your free soul
You are still the same for honor and friends
We are destined for different paths by strict fate
As we entered life we quickly drifted apart
But by chance on a country road
We met and hugged like brothers
When fate's wrath befell me
For everyone a stranger is like a homeless orphan
Under the storm my head drooped languidly
And the prophet of the Permessian maidens was waiting for you
And you came inspired son of laziness
Oh Delvig your voice awakened me
The heart's heat has been lulled for so long
And I cheerfully blessed fate
From infancy the spirit of songs burned within us
And we experienced a wondrous excitement
From infancy two muses flew to us
And our lot was sweet with their caress
But I already loved the applause
You proudly sang for the muses and for the soul
I spent my gift as life without attention
You nurtured your genius in silence
The service of the muses does not tolerate vanity
The beautiful must be majestic
But youth advises us slyly
And noisy dreams make us happy
We will come to our senses but it will be late and sad
We look back and see no traces there
Tell me Wilhelm wasn't the same with us
My brother by muse by fate
It's time for our mental torments
The world should not be abandoned by delusions
Let's hide life under the canopy of solitude
I'm waiting for you my belated friend
Come with the fire of a magical story
Bring to life the heart's legends
Let's talk about the turbulent days of the Caucasus
About Schiller about fame about love
It's time for me to feast oh friends
I have a presentiment of a pleasant meeting
Remember the poet's prediction
A year will fly by and I will be with you again
The covenant of my dreams will come true
A year will pass and I will appear to you
Oh how many tears and how many exclamations
And how many cups are raised to heaven
And the first one is fuller friends are fuller
And all to the bottom in honor of our union
Bless the jubilant muse
Bless and live the Lyceum
To the mentors who guarded our youth
To all honor both dead and living
Raising the cup of gratitude to his lips
Without remembering evil we will repay good
Fuller fuller and my heart is on fire
Drink it down to the last drop again
But guess who else
Hurray our king let's drink to the king
He is a man he rules for a moment
He is a slave to rumors doubts and passions
Let us forgive him for his unjust persecution
He took Paris and founded the Lyceum
Have a feast while we are still here
Alas our circle is thinning out hour by hour
Who sleeps in a coffin who is a distant orphan
Fate looks at us we are withering the days are running
Invisibly bowing and growing cold
We are approaching our beginning
Which of us will have Lyceum Day in our old age
One will have to triumph
An unhappy friend among new generations
A tiresome guest superfluous and alien
He will remember us and the days of unions
Closing my eyes with a trembling hand
Let him be with joy even if sad
Then he will spend this day at the cup
How now I am your disgraced recluse
He spent it without grief and worries
In the wilderness exhausted by the Lenten life
With a swollen belly
I don't soar I sit like an eagle
And I am sick with idleness that is diarrhea
I keep a stock of papers
Alien to the strain of inspiration
I rarely go to Parnassus
And only out of great need
But your intricate manure
It tickles my nose pleasantly
He reminds me of Khvostov
Father of toothy pigeons
And my spirit calls again
To the excrement of former days
The king frowned
Spoke Yesterday
A storm came
Monument to Peter
He got scared
I didn't know it already
The king burst out laughing
First brother April
He spoke with grief
To the maids of honor of the palace
They hang him overseas
For two -
That is I understand
He suddenly said
They hang you by the neck
But the law is cruel
In the woods in the darkness of the idle night
Spring's diverse singer
It rumbles and whistles and thunders
But the stupid cuckoo
Selfish chatterbox
The cuckoo keeps repeating his own words
And the echo after her is the same
They made us sad
At least run away God save us
From the elegiac cuckoo
There is no movement said the bearded sage
The other one kept silent and began to walk in front of him
He couldn't have objected more strongly
Everyone praised the intricate answer
But gentlemen this is a funny incident
Another example comes to mind for me
After all the sun walks before us every day
However the stubborn Galileo is right
All as a sacrifice to your memory
And the voice of the inspired lyre
And the tears of the inflamed maiden
And the trembling of my jealousy
And the glory of glory and the darkness of exile
And the beauty of bright thoughts
And revenge is a stormy dream
Of fierce suffering
What to do Faust
This is the limit set for you
Nobody crosses it
All rational creatures are bored
Some people are lazy and some are not in business
Who believes and who has lost faith
He didn't have time to enjoy it
He enjoyed himself beyond measure
And everyone yawns and lives
And the coffin awaits you all yawning
Yawn too
Rest of the soul
I am a psychologist here is science
Tell me when you weren't bored
Think look for it then
How he dozed over Virgil
And the rods excited your mind
Then how did he crown with roses
You are the joy of the gracious maidens
And in the noisy riot he dedicated
They are in the heat of an evening hangover
Then how did you plunge
Into generous dreams
Into the dark abyss of science
But I remember it then out of boredom
Like a harlequin from fire
You finally called me
I writhed like a little demon
I tried to cheer you up
I took him to witches and spirits
And why is it all so trivial
You wanted glory and you achieved it
I wanted to fall in love and I did
You took the possible toll from life
And was he happy
Stop it
Don't aggravate my wounds with secrets
There is no life in deep knowledge
I cursed the false light of knowledge
And glory is her random ray
Elusive Worldly Honor
Meaningless as a dream But there is
Direct good combination
Two souls
Oh what a wonderful dream!
O pure flame of love
There where there is shadow where there is woody noise
Where the sweet-ringing streams
There on her lovely chest
Rest the languid head
I was happy
Heavenly Creator
You are delirious Faust in reality
A helpful recollection
You are deceiving yourself
Didn't I help you with my efforts
Delivered a miracle of beauty
And at the deep hour of midnight
I brought her together with you then
The fruits of your labor
I was having fun alone
I remember everything about the two of you
When the beauty is yours
I was delighted and in rapture
You are a restless soul
I was already deep in thought
And you and I proved it
That thinking is the seed of boredom
And do you know my philosopher
What were you thinking at such a time
When no one thinks
Should I say
You thought my lamb was obedient
How greedily I desired you
How cunning in a simple-minded maiden
I disturbed the dreams of the heart
Love involuntary and selfless
She gave herself up innocently
Well my chest is full now
With hated melancholy and boredom
To the sacrifice of my whim
I look drunk with pleasure
With irresistible disgust
So reckless fool
In vain I decided to do an evil deed
Having stabbed a beggar to death in the forest
Scolds the flayed body
So on to selling beauty
Having had his fill of it in a hurry
Debauchery looks askance fearfully
Then from all this
You have drawn one conclusion
Spanish three-masted ship
Ready to dock in Holland
There are about three hundred scoundrels on it
Two monkeys barrels of gold
Yes a rich load of chocolate
Yes it is a fashionable disease
Recently given to you
The storm covers the sky with darkness
Snow whirls whirl
She will howl like a beast
Then he will cry like a child
Then along the dilapidated roof
Suddenly the straw rustles
Like a belated traveler
He'll knock on our window
Our dilapidated shack
And sad and dark
What are you my old lady
She fell silent by the window
Or the howling of a storm
You are tired my friend
Or doze under the buzzing
Of your spindle
Let's drink good friend
Of my poor youth
Let's drink to our sorrows where is the mug
The heart will be happier
Sing me a song like a titmouse
Lived quietly across the sea
Sing me a song like a girl
I went for water in the morning
The storm covers the sky with darkness
Snow whirls whirl
She will howl like a beast
Then he will cry like a child
Let's drink good friend
Of my poor youth
Let's drink to our sorrows where is the mug
The heart will be happier
My Sister's Garden
Secluded vineyard
She has a clean key from the mountain
The sealed one does not run
My fruits are shining
Bulk gold
I have running noise
The waters are pure and living
Nard aloe and cinnamon
Rich in fragrance
As soon as the aquilon blows
And the aromas will drip
The fire of desire burns in the blood
My soul is hurt by you
Kiss me with your kisses
Myrrh and wine are sweeter to me
Bow your tender head to me
And may I rest in peace
While the merry day dies
And the night shadow will move
Did you see the girl on the rock
In white clothes above the waves
When raging in the stormy darkness
The sea played with the shores
When the ray of lightning illuminated
Her scarlet shine is ever present
And the wind beat and flew
With her flying veil
The sea is beautiful in the stormy darkness
And the sky in sparkles without azure
But believe me maiden on the rock
More beautiful than the waves of heaven and storm
What are you bothering about prose writer
Give me any thought you want
I'll sharpen it from the end
I will feather with flying rhyme
I will put it on a tight bowstring
I will bend the obedient bow into an arc
And then I'll send it at random
And woe to our enemy
The days are shorter and the nights are longer
It's a boring time
And the sun seems to be forced
Looks at the harvested field
What to do on winter evenings
Until they served us food
Would you like to listen now
My esteemed friends
The story of good Robert
Who lived during the time of Dagobert
He was driving home from Rome
Having very little money
This knight was handsome
He is sensible even though he is young
At that time money
And so that he would not dare to perform miracles in the future
Having caught truly hang
And to deprive one of one's life
Although poems for name days
Natalia Sophia Katerina
It may not be in fashion anymore
But I am your faithful admirer
I am a sign of exemplary obedience
I am ready to serve you with them too
But I curse myself
When I know why
You have been baptized with grace
No no in my opinion
And your speech and gaze are sad
And the leg I dare to tell you
This is all extremely sweet
But destruction is not grace
Under what constellation
Under what planet
You were born a young man
Near Mercury
Al Saturn distant
Mars Cypridine
A young man was born
Under the unknown star
Under the falling star
Flashing for a moment
In the silence of heaven
What's wrong with you tell me brother
You are as pale as a blasphemer
Hair stands up like a mountain
Or with a young maiden
You were caught at the fence
And taking you for a thief
The guard was chasing you
Or are you confused by a ghost
Or for grave sins
Tormented by wild inspiration
Do you write poetry
There the star of dawn rose
The rose blossomed luxuriantly
This time we were
They called to each other
And she appeared
At the door or at the window
Brighter than the early star
Fresher than the morning roses
On a downy bed
Maiden with a sleepy hand
I wiped my languid eyes
Removing the dreams of the night
I only see her
It seemed easier around me
The morning air was flowing
I became more free
Among the sheep of the whole village
I am my beauty
Knew a favorite sheep
I took her to the river
To the shady banks
To the green meadows
I gave her drink and cherished her
I sowed flowers in front of her
The virgin came to me from afar
Approached in silence
I meet the beautiful one
He sang while strumming his guitar
Virgins of my joy
There is no one sweeter in the world
Who dares under the moon
Argue in happiness with me
I don't envy the kings
I don't envy the gods
As I see the languid eyes
Thin figure and dark braids
This is how he used to sing to her
And my beauty
The heart admired the song
But the bliss passed
Where is my beauty
I cry alone
Replaced songs with tender ones
Moaning and tears are hopeless
I was not born to praise the holy place
My weak voice will not rise to heaven
But I must prepare you now
To hear John's miracles
She saved the French lilies
In battles with her maiden hand
The overseas villains are defeated
Shining with mighty beauty
She was a hero under her skirt
I confess to the evening time
The humble maiden is dearer to me
Obedient as a lamb of the field
Joanna was a lioness in spirit
Amidst the toils and harsh weather conditions
She was the most glorious of all the knights
And what is most wonderful is the most difficult
The color remained virgin all year round
O you singer of this miraculous maiden
The grey-haired singer whose hoarse melodies
A disordered mind and a stupid taste
In the old days they enraged the gentle muses
Would you like oh frail poet
Honor me with your violin
No I don't want to Give it to me my dear
To any of the fashionable rhymers
Alas in vain for the proud maiden
I offered my love
Neither our life nor our blood
Her soul will not be touched by the firm
I'll only be fed with tears
Even though my heart will be split by sadness
She's on a splinter -
But it won't allow it either
I had to reckon with you again
The singer of love is sometimes lively and sometimes sad
You play the lyre very nicely
You play shtos pretty badly
Five hundred rubles lost by you
There are real witnesses to this
My fate is similar to your fate
Now my friend you will see why
The midday heat scorches the meadows
The poor shepherd sleeps near the flock
The hero is tired under armor
The coolness of the stream attracts him
Here he thinks to find peace
And here the unfortunate man found
A shelter of cruelty and horror
He walks in the trees
There are inscriptions everywhere
He looked at these features with amazement
A familiar handwriting notices
An involuntary fear draws him
He will recognize the hand of his beloved
And indeed in the midday heat
Medor with the Chinese princess
From the shepherd's hut here
The friend himself sometimes appeared
Orland reads their names
United by a monogram
Each letter is a nail
The hero's heart is pierced
Trying to lull the mind
He is being hypocritical with himself
He doesn't want to believe but at least he believes
He tries to imagine
What monograms in this wild grove
Anything can be written down
Another Angelica
But soon the knight said to you
However these features are to me
I know you very well I understand
This Medor was invented only by her
Under this nickname I
The princess may have praised
So replace the truth with a fable
He thinks that he will help fate
But how is he more cunning
To ease my suffering
All the more evil suspicion
The light is on again
So in the net the bird is a friend of freedom
The more it beats the stronger it gets
The more entangled he becomes in it
Orlando goes where the vaults are
The mountain bent down to the stream
Crooked wandering dodder
The shadowy entrance was curtained
Medor with the lovely Angelica
We loved it here by the fresh waters
On a hot day in a quiet hour of leisure
Breathe in each other's arms
And here their names are all around
Trees and stones were preserved
With chalk charcoal or a knife
Everywhere the lucky ones wrote
The sad count walked there
It goes over the dark cave
He sees an inscription in praise of fun
Medor with her languid hand
In those days I wrote in verse
Poems of tender feelings inspiration
He wrote in Arabic
And here is their exact meaning
Flowers meadows stream alive
Happy Grotto Cool Shadows
A haven of love fun and laziness
Where is young with Angelica
With the lovely daughter of Galafron
Beloved by many at times
I knew the pleasures of Cupid
How shall I reward you poor thing
So often guarded by you
I will only serve one person
With praise and humble request
I pray to the Lord lovers
I will give knights and all sorts of
Aliens from here or travelers
Which are in this direction
Fortune will lead you by chance
To the waters the meadow the shade and the forest
Call for the grace of heaven
So that the nymphs would love them secretly
So that the shepherds never come to them
The greedy herds were not driven
Two three times and five and six
He wants to reread the inscription
The unfortunate man tries in vain
To say that there is nothing that exists
He sees the truth he sees it clearly
And unbearable melancholy
As if a cold hand
It squeezes his heart terribly
And finally to my shame
He fixed an indifferent gaze
He is ready in silent grief
To lose feelings to leave the light
Oh believe me there is no flour
Such a terrible torment
Leaning his beard on his chest
The slain pale one bowed his brow
The poor knight can't find it
Not a cry not a tear
Crystal poet renewed
Decorate my peaceful corner
The pledge of sacred poetry
And the sweet pledge of friendship
There is a healing heat hidden within you
The lips are barely eloquent
They touched you and in an instant
His mind is a playful fire
Mysteriously penetrated you
Under the blue sky of my native country
She languished and faded
Faded at last and right above me
The young shadow was already flying
But there is an inaccessible line between us
In vain did I arouse feelings
From indifferent lips I heard the news of death
And I listened to her indifferently
So this is who I loved with a fiery soul
With such heavy tension
With such tender languid longing
With such madness and torment
Where is the torment where is the love Alas in my soul
For the poor gullible shadow
For the sweet memory of irretrievable days
I find neither tears nor penance
So the sea is an ancient murderer
Your genius ignites
You glorify with a golden lyre
Neptune's terrible trident
Do not glorify him in our vile age
Gray Neptune is the Earth's ally
Man is in all elements
Tyrant traitor or prisoner
Who inspired you with languages
Your message is bold
How naughty you are and how sweet you are
What an excess of feelings and strength
What youthful riot
No not with Castalian water
You have made your Kamena drunk
Pegasus another Hippocrene
I kicked it out in front of you with my hoof
It doesn't flow coldly with moisture
But it foams with heady brew
She is drunk and raving
How noble is this drink
Merging rum and wine
Without impurity of unsuitable water
In Trigorskoye there is a thirst for freedom
Opened in our times
Like on the wide Volga River
A sharp-nosed boat sailed out
Like the rowers on a boat they are brave
Cossacks are young guys
The owner himself sits at the stern
The master himself is formidable Stenka Razin
There is a red maiden in front of him
The Captured Persian Princess
Stenka Razin does not look at the princess
And he looks at his mother on the Volga
As the formidable Stenka Razin said
Oh you are goy Volga my dear mother
You have made me drunk since my foolish years
In debt the night rocked and rocked
In rough weather it carried out
Didn't the young man doze off for me
She endowed my Cossacks with goodness
That we haven't given you anything yet
How the formidable Stenka Razin jumped up here
Picked up the Persian princess
He threw the red maiden into the waves
He bowed to Mother Volga with it
Stenka Razin walked
In Astrakhan city
Trade goods
Became a voivode
Demand gifts
Stenka Razin brought it
Crunchy stones
Crunchy stones
Golden brocades
Became a voivode
Demand a fur coat
The fur coat is expensive
The floors are new
One beaver
Another sable
He is Stenka Razin
Doesn't give up the fur coat
Give it to Stenka Razin
Give me your fur coat off your shoulder
If you give it back thank you
If you don't give it back I'll hang you
What's in the open field
On the green oak
Yes in a dog fur coat
Stenka Razin became
Think a thought
Good voivode
Get yourself a fur coat
Get yourself a fur coat
There wouldn't be any noise
What is not a horse's stomp not a human rumor
It is not the trumpeter's trumpet that is heard from the field
And the weather whistles and hums
Whistles hums pours out
Stenka Razin calls me
Walk along the blue sea
You are a fine fellow you are a dashing robber
You are a dashing robber you are a wild and dissolute brawler
You get on your fast boats
Unfurl the canvas sails
Escapes on the sea in blue
I'll bring you three boats
On the first ship is red gold
The second ship is pure silver
On the third ship there is a soul-maiden
Be like a full cup
Happy home for the young
Your happiness is incomprehensible
But keep quiet about everything
What a wonder what a mess!
For my sanity
Damn it but it's your will
I won't say anything
It's a real holiday for me and Masha
To the friend of my heart
Never about our happiness
We won't say anything
Wait I'll guess right away
The sorrow of your heart
I understand I understand
Don't blab anything
Strict judgment and your word
We value it most of all
Are you the only one who thinks about our happiness
They didn't say anything
He is my age he is so sweet
I always saw him as a brother
He loved me like a sister
Tell me how I am guilty
No Masha it's not your fault
And this wedding will not happen
I love you even though I'm mad
Even though this work and shame are in vain
And in this unfortunate stupidity
At your feet I confess
It doesn't suit me and it's not my age
It's time for me to be smarter
But I recognize it by all the signs
The disease of love in my soul
Without you I'm bored I yawn
I feel sad in front of you I endure it
I can't even say I want to
My angel how I love you
When I hear from the living room
Your light step or the noise of your dress
Or a virginal innocent voice
I suddenly lose all my mind
You will smile at me my joy
You will turn away from me sadness
A reward for a day of torment
I love your pale hand
When diligently at the hoop
You sit leaning over carelessly
Eyes and curls drooping
I am silently tenderly moved
I admire you like a child
Should I tell you my misfortune
My jealous sadness
When to walk sometimes in bad weather
You are going far away
And your tears alone
And speeches in the corner together
And trips to Opochka
And the piano in the evening
Alina have mercy on me
I don't dare demand love
Maybe for my sins
My angel I am not worth love
But pretend This look
Everything can be expressed so wonderfully
Ah it's not hard to deceive me
I am glad to deceive myself
Tormented by spiritual thirst
I dragged myself through the gloomy desert
And the six-winged seraph
At the crossroads he appeared to me
With fingers as light as a dream
He touched my pupils
The prophetic pupils have opened
Like a frightened eagle
He touched my ears
And they were filled with noise and ringing
And I heard the trembling of the sky
And the heavenly flight of angels
And the bastard of the sea underwater move
And the vines grow weaker
And he pressed his lips to my lips
And the sinner tore out my tongue
Both idle and cunning
And the sting of the wise snake
My frozen lips
He put it in with his bloody right hand
And he cut my chest with a sword
And he took out the trembling heart
And the coal burning with fire
He pushed it into the open chest
I lay like a corpse in the desert
And the voice of God called to me
Arise prophet and see and listen
Be filled with my will
And going around the seas and lands
Burn people's hearts with the verb
I saw you I read them
These lovely creatures
Where are your languid dreams
They idolize their ideal
I drank the poison in your gaze
In soul-filled features
And in your sweet conversation
And in your fiery verses
Rivals of the Forbidden Rose
Blessed is the immortal ideal
A hundred times blessed is he who inspired you
Not many rhymes and a lot of prose
Friend of my harsh days
My decrepit dove
Alone in the wilderness of pine forests
You've been waiting for me for a long time
You are under the window of your room
You grieve as if you were on the clock
And the knitting needles linger every minute
In your wrinkled hands
You look into the forgotten gates
To the black distant path
The longing for a premonition of care
They squeeze your chest all the time
It seems to you
At Galliani or Collioni
Order for yourself in Tver
Parmasan macaroni
Yes cook some eggs
Have lunch at your leisure
At Pozharsky's in Torzhok
Fried cutlets try the cutlets
And go lightly
How will it get to Yazhelbitsy
Kolymagu little man
My friend will spoil it
Your voluptuous little eye
They will bring you trout
They were ordered to be cooked immediately
As you see they turn blue
Pour a glass of Chablis into the fish soup
So that the fish soup is to your liking
You can put it in boiling water
Add some pepper
A small piece of onion
How happy I am when I can leave
The annoying noise of the capital and the courtyard
And run away into the deserted oak groves
To the shores of these silent waters
Oh how soon will she come out of the river bottom
Will rise like a goldfish
How sweet is her appearance
From the quiet waves in the light of the moonlit night
Entangled in green hair
She sits on a steep bank
Slender legs like white waves of foam
They caress merging and murmuring
Her eyes sometimes dim sometimes sparkle
Like twinkling stars in the sky
There is no breath from her lips but how much
Piercingly these wet blue lips
A cool kiss without breathing
Tender and sweet in the summer heat
Cold honey is not so sweet to thirst
When she plays with her fingers
Then it touches my curls
Instant chill runs through like horror
My head and heart are beating loudly
Painfully dying with love
And at this moment I am glad to leave life
I want to moan and drink her kisses
And her speech What sounds can
Compared to her the baby's first babble
The murmur of waters or the May noise of the sky
Or the ringing gusli of Boyan Slavya
My first friend is my priceless friend
And I blessed fate
When my yard is secluded
Covered in sad snow
Your bell rang
I pray to holy providence
Yes my voice is your soul
Grants the same consolation
May he illuminate the imprisonment
By the rays of the clear days of the Lyceum
In the hope of glory and goodness
I look forward without fear
The beginning of Peter's glorious days
Riots and executions plagued
But he attracted hearts with truth
But morals were tamed by science
And was from a violent archer
Dolgoruky is distinguished before him
With an autocratic hand
He boldly sowed enlightenment
He did not despise his native country
He knew her purpose
Now an academic now a hero
Sometimes a sailor sometimes a carpenter
He is an all-encompassing soul
On the throne was the eternal worker
Be proud of your family resemblance
Be like your ancestor in everything
How tireless and firm he is
And the memory of how kind he is
No she is not a Circassian
But in the valleys of Georgia from time immemorial
Such a maiden did not come down
From the heights of gloomy Kazbek
No there is no agate in her eyes
But all the treasures of the East
Not worth the sweet rays
Her midday eye
Through the wavy fogs
The moon is creeping through
To the sad fields
She pours out a sad light
Along the boring winter road
The greyhound troika is running
The bell is monotonous
It rattles tiresomely
Something sounds familiar
In the long songs of the coachman
That revelry is wild
It's a heartache
No fire no black hut
Wilderness and snow to meet me
Only the miles are striped
They come across one
Boring sad tomorrow Nina
Returning to my darling tomorrow
I'll forget myself by the fireplace
I can't get enough of looking
The hour hand rings loudly
It will complete its measured circle
And removing the annoying ones
Midnight will not separate us
Sad Nina my path is boring
My driver fell silent while he was sleeping
The bell is monotonous
The moon's face is clouded
There is a lamp in the Jewish hut
In one corner a pale light is burning
An old man stands before a lamp
Reads the Bible Gray
Hair falls on the book
Above the empty cradle
A young Jewish woman is crying
He sits in the other corner with his head up
The young Jew looked downcast
Deep in thought
In a sad hut an old woman
Preparing a late meal
The old man closed the holy book
The copper clasps were closed
The old woman puts on a poor supper
He invites the whole family to the table
No one goes without food
The hours flow in silence
Everything fell asleep under the shadow of night
One Jewish hut
Didn't have a pleasant dream
On the city bell tower
It strikes midnight Suddenly with a heavy hand
Knocking on their door The family shuddered
The young Jew gets up and the door
Opens it with bewilderment
And an unknown wanderer enters
In his hand is a walking stick
You are the Mother of God no doubt about it
Not the one that is beautiful
Only the Holy Spirit captivated me
You are sweet to everyone without exception
Not the one who is Christ
Gave birth without asking her husband
There is another god of the earthly circle
Beauty obeys him
He is the god of Parni Tibullus Moore
I suffer from them but I am comforted by them
He's all in you you're Cupid's mother
You are my Mother of God
Under the cold of old age he was gloomily fading away
One of Catherine's grey eagles
With his wings heavy he forgot the sky
And the sharp peaks of Pinda
At that time you got up your beam warmed him
He raised both his wings and his eyes to the sky
And with noisy joy he leapt up and flew away
On the meeting of your morning star
Mordvinov didn't love you in vain Petrov
He is proud of you even on the banks of Cocytus
You justified the lyre you never changed
Hopes of the prophetic poet
How gloriously you have kept his prophecy
Shining with valor and glory and science
In councils I am motionless at my place
You are standing there the new Dolgoruky
So rolling down from the mountain tops into the foamy stream
The grey cliff stands in vain the shores tremble
In vain does the thunder rumble and the waves rage around
And they curl and splash
One on his shoulders having raised his mighty labor
You keep a watchful eye over the royal treasury
The widow's poor mite and the tribute of Siberian ores
Equally sacred before you
In the depths of Siberian ores
Keep proud patience
Your sorrowful work will not be in vain
And the high aspiration of thoughts
Faithful sister to misfortune
Hope in the Dark Dungeon
Will awaken vigor and joy
The desired time will come
Love and friendship to you
They will reach through the dark locks
Like in your penal burrows
My free voice reaches
The heavy shackles will fall
The dungeons will collapse and freedom will come
You will be greeted joyfully at the entrance
And the brothers will give you the sword
In the silence of the gardens in the spring in the darkness of the nights
The oriental nightingale sings over the rose
But the dear rose does not feel or heed
And under the hymn of love he sways and dozes
Isn't that how you sing for cold beauty
Come to your senses poet what are you striving for
She does not listen to the poet she does not feel him
You look she blooms you call there is no answer
The bow rings the arrow trembles
And Python died swirling
And your face shines with victory
Belvedere Apollo
Who stood up for Python
Who broke your idol
You are Apollo's rival
Belvedere Mitrofan
There is a rose it is wonderful
Before the astonished Cythera
Blooms blush and lush
Blessed by Venus
In vain are Kifer and Paphos
The breath of frost kills
Glitters between the minute roses
The Everlasting Rose
When it happened in the old days
A spirit or a ghost appeared
That drove Satan away
This is a simple saying
Amen amen crumble in our days
Much less demons and ghosts
God knows where they went
But you are my evil or good genius
When I see before me
Your profile and eyes and golden curls
When I hear your voice
And the speeches are lively and lively
I am enchanted I am on fire
And I tremble before you
And to a heart full of dreams
Amen amen crumble I say
Among the scattered Moscow
When talking about whist and boston
With the ballroom babble of rumors
Do you like Apollo games
Queen of Muses and Beauty
You hold me with your gentle hand
Magic Scepter of Inspirations
And over the thoughtful brow
Double crowned wreath
And the genius swirls and burns
The singer captivated by you
Do not reject humble tribute
Listen to my voice with a smile
How to pass by Catalani
The nomadic woman listens to the gypsy
My soul Pavel
Stick to my rules
Love this and that
Don't do this or that
It seems clear
Goodbye my beautiful
Far away from you
I will be inseparable from you
Languid lips and languid eyes
I will be tormented by memory
Languishing in silence
I don't want to be consoled
Will you sigh for me
If I am hanged
In the sad and boundless worldly steppe
Three keys mysteriously broke through
The Key of Youth is a fast and rebellious key
It boils runs sparkling and gurgling
Castalian key with a wave of inspiration
In the secular steppe the exiles are given drink
The last key is the cold key of Oblivion
He will quench the heart's fire more sweetly than anyone else
There were many of us on the boat
Others strained the sail
Others resisted unanimously
Into the depths the oars are powerful In the silence
Our smart helmsman leans over the steering wheel
The heavy boat ruled in silence
And I am full of carefree faith
I sang to the swimmers Suddenly the bosom of the waves
The noisy whirlwind crushed him on the fly
Both the helmsman and the swimmer died
Only I am the mysterious singer
thrown ashore by a thunderstorm
I sing the same hymns
And my wet robe
I dry it in the sun under a rock
At the gates of Eden there is a gentle angel
His head was hanging down and shining
And the demon is dark and rebellious
Flew over the hellish abyss
The spirit of denial the spirit of doubt
He looked upon the pure spirit
And the involuntary heat of tenderness
For the first time I vaguely recognized
Forgive me he said I saw you
And it was not in vain that you shone for me
I didn't hate everything in the sky
I didn't despise everything in the world
What a night! The frost is bitter
There is not a single cloud in the sky
Like a sewn canopy the blue vault
It is dotted with frequent stars
It's all dark in the houses at the gates
Gates with heavy locks
People are at rest everywhere
The noise and shouting of trade has died down
Only the courtyard guard barks
And the chain rattles loudly
And all of Moscow sleeps peacefully
Forgetting the excitement of fear
And the square in the darkness of the night
It's full of yesterday's execution
Fresh traces of torment all around
Where is the corpse chopped up with a swing
Where is the pillar where are the pitchforks there are the boilers
Cooled full of resin
Here is an overturned chopping block
Iron teeth stick out
With bones piles of ash are smoldering
The dead are huddled on the stakes
The numb ones turn black
Recently there has been blood on all sides
The snow was crimsoned with a thin stream
And a languid groan arose
But death touched them like a dream
She captured her prey
Who's there Whose horse is at full gallop
It rushes across the menacing square
Whose whistle whose loud talk
In the darkness of the night there is a sound
Who is this brave Pitchfork
He's in a hurry to fly to a date
Desire boils in his chest
He says My horse is dashing
My faithful horse fly like an arrow
Hurry hurry but the horse is spirited
Suddenly he waved his braided mane
And stood in the darkness between the pillars
On the oak crossbar
The corpse swayed the rider was stern
I was ready to rush under it
But the greyhound beats under the whip
Snorts and snorts and tears
Back Where is my dashing horse
What are you afraid of What's wrong with you
Weren't we the ones jumping here yesterday
Didn't we trample furiously
Zealous revenge of grief
The tsar's daring traitors
Aren't they washed in their blood
Your damask hooves
Now I don't recognize them anymore
My greyhound horse my dashing horse
Rush fly and the tired horse
Galloped into the pillars
Spring is the season of love
How hard your appearance is for me
What a languid excitement
In my soul in my blood
How alien to the heart is pleasure
All that rejoices and shines
It brings boredom and languor
Give me the snowstorm and the blizzard
And the long winter darkness of nights
The darling of light-winged fashion
At least I'm not British or French
You have created again my dear wizard
I am the pet of pure Muses
And I laugh at the grave
Having departed for a century from the bonds of death
I see myself as if in a mirror
But this mirror flatters me
It says that I will not humiliate
The Predilections of Important Aonids
So to Rome Dresden to Paris
My appearance will be known from now on
Having finally reached the earth
Saved from storms by providence
Holy Lady Swimmer
He carries his gift with reverence
So I dedicate it with tenderness
My simple withered crown
You have a high light
In the ethereal silence of the heavens
You look so cute shining
For our pious eyes
Doesn't require a poet yet
To the sacred sacrifice of Apollo
In the cares of the vain world
He is cowardly immersed
His holy lyre is silent
The soul tastes a cold sleep
And among the insignificant children of the world
Perhaps he is the most insignificant of all
But only the divine verb
It will touch the sensitive ear
The poet's soul will be stirred
Like an awakened eagle
He yearns for the world's amusements
Avoids human gossip
At the feet of the people's idol
Doesn't bow his proud head
He runs wild and stern
And full of sounds and confusion
To the shores of deserted waves
Into the wide-noisy oak groves
Near the places where golden Venice reigns
One night rower steering a gondola
By the light of Vesper floats along the seashore
Rinalda Godfred Erminia sings
He loves his song he sings it for fun
Without long-term plans one knows no glory
No fear no hope and full of quiet music
Knows how to delight his way over the abyss of waves
On the sea of life where the storms are so cruel
They chase my lonely sail in the darkness
How he without response comfortingly I sing
And I love to think about secret poems
Doubt fear vicious hope
I can no longer store it in my chest
I am Philip's unfaithful wife
And I dare to love my son
But how can you see him and not love him
Temperament: ardent kind proud noble
A high mind with a beautiful appearance
Beautiful soul Why nature
And the heavens created you like this
What am I saying Oh will I be able to do it in time
From the depths of the heart a sweet image
Eradicate O if my flame
He will become suspicious before him
I'm always sad but I avoid
I meet him He knows what fun is
In Spain it is prohibited Who can
In my soul read Ah and myself
I can't And he is like the others
He will be deceived and become like others
He runs away from me Alas poor me
There is no other consolation for me in my grief
Besides tears tears are crimes
I'm going home I'll be free there
What do I see Karl Let's go change me
And speech and gaze all can ah let's leave
Take this skull Delvig on
It belongs to you by right
I'll tell you Baron
His gothic glory
This venerable skull has been seen more than once
He was heated by the vapors of Bacchus
Lithuanian Sword in Evil Hour
It hit him with a ringing sound
I didn't pass through this bone
Apollo's life-giving ray
Well in a word he kept this skull
The Baron's Heavy Brain
Baron Delvig Baron
Of course he was a glorious hunter
The bowl rider is a good friend
The terror of vassals and their wives
My friend such was the harsh age
And your ancestor is strong-headed
The knightly soul would be embarrassed
If only I had you in front of me
I saw him without his military clothes
With a head crowned with myrtles
With glasses and a golden lyre
Deceased in the church register
It was already recorded a long time ago
And with my ancestors in Riga
Tasted an unawakened dream
The Baron in the Sad Abbey
However he was pleased with his fate
Pastor's funeral flattery
Coat of arms of the feudal tomb
And the epitaph is bad
But in our troubled years
There is no rest for the dead
Nature's shaggy darling
Both a mathematician and a poet
Buyan is thoughtful and important
Surgeon lawyer physiologist
Ideologist and philologist
In short you are a student juror
With a twisted tube in his teeth
In a cloak with a club and a moustache
He appeared in Riga There he was haughtily
He began to foam beer in taverns
In the smoke of tobacco clouds
Wander over the seashores
Dreaming of Lothen or from grief
Write poetry and beat the Jews
A student under the stairs of the tavern
In a dark closet there lived one
There in the form of mirrors and paintings
Short cape rapier
Hanged on the wall side by side
Half-scratched album
The creation of Fichte and Plato
Yes two eastern lexicons
Under the web in the corner
They lay in a heap on the floor
The subject of various occupations
A scientist and hungry rats
We know empty luxury
A venerable thinker does not seek
Laughing at the silly fuss
In the closet he whistles carelessly
The sage preached moderation
The imprint of high hearts
The student however finally
Noticed an important flaw
In his everyday life he has an object
A skeleton was needed
A subject dear to philosophers
The item is pleasant and useful
There are no words for the eyes and the heart
But where will he get the skeleton
Here he is one Sunday
Got together with the city priest
And immediately taking into consideration
His character and service
Decided to make friends with him
Over a glass of beer my dreamer
Opened up his soul to the clergyman
And he says “Can’t you friend”
In your free time
Take me to the graveyard basement
Abundant in idle bones
And meanwhile one skeleton
Help me bring it to light
I swear to you by the Aidesian God
He will be a pledge of friendship for me
And until my last days
The beauty of my abode
The priest was confused and amazed
What a desire what a passion
Go to the secluded basement
To disturb the venerable host of the dead
And steal one of them
And who is He the keeper of the graves
What will the dead say next
But beer is a lullaby for fear
And a pacifier of angry conscience
It resolved doubts in him
Well so be it he gives his word
That everything will be ready by night
And he appoints an hour for his friend
They broke up
The day has faded
Night has come covered with a cloak
Our famous hero stands
At the coffin gallery
And with him is my criminal cleric
Holding a broken lantern in his hand
Ready for a fatal feat
And here the rusty lock squeals
The treacherous door squeals
And now the knights are coming
Into the darkness of the majestic basement
With the meager glow of a lantern
The deaf vaults of illumination
They go and the echo of the grave
Confused in its peace
The sound of footsteps echoes long and drawn out
In front of them is a long row of coffins
Everywhere there are shields coats of arms and crowns
In vain decay all around
They will rest in a deep sleep
Highborn Barons
Take this skull Delvig
It belongs to you by right
You screw him up Baron
In a decent frame
Transform the product of the coffin
Into the pleasure bowl
Sanctify with boiling wine
Yes wash it down with fish soup and porridge
Imitate the Corsair's singer
And the Scandinavians' military paradise
Resurrect in home feasts
Or like Hamlet-Baratynsky
Dream about it thoughtfully
About the life of a dead preacher
Full of wine or empty
For a sage as an interlocutor
He's worth his head alive
The boyar stables are beautiful to everyone
Cleanliness of servants and horses
All are happy good horses
Feeding stalls and supervision
The harness shines on the oak stands
Greyhounds shine in their stalls
Only some people find stables unsuitable
The brownie has taken to visiting the stables
At night he goes to the stables
Cleans and grooms the boyars' horses
Braids their mane into pigtails
The tail is tied tightly into a knot
How can he not fall in love with a black man
At dusk with a watering hole
I'll go around the boyar stables
And I'll go into the black horse's stall
The horse stands well and is humble
And in the morning you'll unlock the stable
The horse is not quiet he is all in a lather and glowing with heat
Bloody foam drips from the muzzle
The brownie rode on him all night long
Through the mountains through the forests through the swamps
From midnight to white light
Before sunset
Oh you old foolish groom
Can you solve the old riddle
A young groom fell in love with a beautiful girl
The young groom is a wild fellow
He unlocks the stable at night
Slowly saddles the raven
Slowly leads out of the gate
He mounts a greyhound horse
He gallops to visit the red maiden
Blessed in the golden circle of nobles
Poet listened to by kings
Owning laughter and tears
Seasoning lies with bitter truth
It tickles the dull taste
And the boyars' arrogance seeks glory
He decorates their feasts
And heeds the wise praises
Meanwhile behind the heavy doors
Huddling around the black wing
People driven by servants
A little further away he listens to the singer
In the Carian grove a cave is hidden that is dear to hunters
Slender pines all around bowed their branches and cast shadows
Its entrance is blocked by the free roaming in the twists and turns
Ivy lover of rocks and crevices From stone to stone
The cave bottom is flooded with a ringing arc
A frisky stream having broken through a deep channel winds
Into the distance through the dense grove delighting it with its sweet murmur
The matchmaker is sad at the table
The cards are decomposed
The young ladies are looking around
The matchmaker tells their fortunes
Three nines ace of hearts
And the king of diamonds
Argument annoyance from speeches
And at the same time updates
And according to the cards expect guests
Need it today
Suddenly there is a knock at the door
The Young Ladies and the Matchmaker
They stood up and pushed the table away
Everyone pushed -
Whisper Katya who came
Look through the crack at least
What a good person
The matchmaker knows him
He's been with b- for a whole century
He feels at home with them
B- to the kitchen to wash your hands
They rushed forward in leaps and bounds
Put on shoes fluff up
Spray yourself with perfume
The guest is a matchmaker in the meantime
Greets affectionately
He asks him to lie down completely
He asks the same question
How is your bargaining going
There are plenty of profits
The bawd grabbed the cheek
And she sighed painfully
Even though I was in bad times
But such grief
I haven't seen it even in my dreams
I want to run across the sea
Do you believe since St Peter's Day
Until Saturday exactly
All the girls are mine
Were out of work
I see four guests
God sends me
I'll take it out for them
Everyone chooses
They study all night
We finished and what
Without paying everyone go away
Oh my god
Guest to her I really feel sorry for you
Hello friend Aneta
What kind of hat is this What kind of shawl is this
Come here Janet
And kiss Louise
If you choose you will offend
So it is for everyone
Only you will see
What does the matchmaker say
Do you want Janet
She's so fired up about it
Or take this one
The poor matchmaker's guest in response
No don't worry
I don't really feel like it
Girls don't be afraid
He left and everything suddenly became quiet
The procuress became despondent
Girls are dozing around
Candle
The matchmaker takes the cards again
Silently guessing again
But no one is coming
The procuress falls asleep
God help you my friends
In the cares of life in royal service
And at the feasts of wild friendship
And in the sweet mysteries of love
God help you my friends
And in storms and in life's sorrows
In a foreign land in a deserted sea
And in the dark abysses of the earth
Do you remember ah your honor
Monsieur Frenchman Mr Captain
As we remember in common parlance
Victory of the Russians over the infidel
Although it doesn't mean much to us
We are not like others so to speak
But in the past we punished you severely
Do you remember Tell me
Do you remember how Suvorov was behind the mountains
Stepping over he attacked you by surprise
How our old man beat you sadists
And I crushed you on my nail like fleas
Although it doesn't mean much to us
We are not like others so to speak
But in the past we punished you severely
Do you remember Tell me
Do you remember how you drove all of Europe
Your Bonaparte brawler is on us alone
We saw many French people then -
And your Mr Captain too
Although it doesn't mean much to us
We are not like others so to speak
But in the past we punished you severely
Do you remember Tell me
Do you remember how your king died from fumes
Suddenly he went crazy as a tambourine naked and bald
Like on fire in Moscow
You fried our Moscow rats
Although it doesn't mean much to us
We are not like others so to speak
But in the past we punished you severely
Do you remember Tell me
Do you remember the false singer
You are our frost among our native snows
And a cheerful battery heater
Soldier's bayonet and noose of the Cossacks
Although it doesn't mean much to us
We are not like others so to speak
But in the past we punished you severely
Do you remember Tell me
Do you remember how we were in Paris
Where is our Cossack or our regimental priest
I fooled you into drinking wine by sitting closer
And he praised your wives yes -
Although it doesn't mean much to us
We are not like others so to speak
But in the past we punished you severely
Do you remember Tell me
Where the sea splashes forever
On the deserted rocks
Where the moon shines warmer
In the sweet hour of evening darkness
Where in harems enjoying
Muslims spend their days
There the sorceress is caressing
She gave me a talisman
And she spoke caressingly
Save my talisman
There is a mysterious power in it
He was given to you by love
From illness from the grave
In a storm in a terrible hurricane
Your head my dear
My talisman won't save me
And the riches of the East
He won't give you any gifts
And the worshipers of the prophet
He won't conquer you
And you into the bosom of a friend
From sad foreign lands
To the native land to the north from the south
My talisman will not be carried away
But when the eyes are treacherous
They will suddenly charm you
Or lips in the darkness of the night
They will kiss without loving
A dear friend from crime
From new wounds of the heart
From betrayal to oblivion
Save my talisman
O you who combined
With deep feeling the taste is only true
And a precise mind and exemplary style
O you who escaped
Sentimentality of mannered
And in the lightest madrigal
He knew how
I know the area there on the shore
The sea splashes alone
The sun shines cloudlessly there
To the scorched meadows
The oak groves are not visible the steppe is bare
One spreads over the sea
No I am not a flatterer when it comes to the king
I freely compose praise
I express my feelings boldly
I speak with the language of the heart
I just fell in love with him
He rules us with courage and honesty
He suddenly revived Russia
War hopes labors
Oh no at least youth is boiling in him
But the spirit of the state is not cruel in him
To whom he punishes clearly
He secretly does mercy
My life flowed in exile
I dragged out separation from my loved ones
But he gave me his royal hand
I am with you again
He honored the inspiration in me
He freed my thoughts
And am I in heartfelt emotion
I will not sing his praises
I am a flatterer No brothers the flatterer is deceitful
He will bring grief upon the king
It is from his sovereign rights
Only mercy will limit
He will say despise the people
The gentle voice of the wilderness of nature
He will say the fruit of enlightenment
Debauchery and a certain rebellious spirit
Woe to the land where there is a slave and a flatterer
Some are close to the throne
And the singer chosen by heaven
He is silent looking down
So the elegiac lyre
You have changed our moralist
On the dean's satire
I praise the poet to the world
The whistle of the rod is good for him
I feel very sorry for your Arist
With what fervor he prayed
And how unhappily he played
The youth got carried away
He lost everything and disappeared
Damon your man is terrible
Forget his dangerous house
Where however I confess to that
My friend you behaved wonderfully
You weren't bothering anyone there
Arista was tenderly consoled
Gave useful advice
And I didn't lose a ruble
I love poets like this
And then I teach the crazy world
Sometimes even a preacher sins
Listen Persian heir
My story
Someone is my neighbor
In the languor of noble thirst
Having sipped a glass of Castalian waters
On players like you once
He wrote an evil satire
And I read it to my friend with fervor
His friend responded to him
He took the cards and shuffled them silently
The moral writer also gave a chance to film
Unfortunately I was ponting all night
Do you know this prankster
But meeting him would be a treat for me
I'm ready to stay up all night with him
And until the midday glow
Read moral messages
And to write his loss
A hundred years have passed since the Teuton
He paid for himself in the blood of the infidels
He ruled the land of midnight
The cockroach has already fallen into shackles
Or he hid in Lithuania
Carried the exiled head
Between hostile shores
Nemen flowed on one
Still above the ancient walls
The towers and all around were shining
The centuries-old groves rustled
The holy havens of the spirits
German symbol on the other
The cross of faith raising to heaven
Your embrace is threatening
It seemed to be captured from above
Wanted the entire region of Palemon
And the tribe of alien law
To drag to your sole
With bear skin on the shoulders
In a shaggy lynx hat with a bun
With tempered arrows and a faithful bow
Young Lithuanians in crowds
They were wandering around from one side
And they kept a close eye on the enemy
On the other hand covered with a bump
Armored and mounted
The German is on guard for his enemies
Motionlessly following with eyes
He loaded the pishchal with prayer
Everyone guarded the crossing
Nemen's current is hospitable
Witness of their mutual enmity
Became the pragmatist of eternity for them
The voice of friendly relations has died down
And everyone who has crossed the waters
Was deprived of life or freedom
Only the hops of the Lithuanian shores
Captivated by the German poplar
Across the river between the reeds
The daring one was crossing
The shores of the opposite reached
And he hugged his friend tenderly
Only the nightingales of oak groves and mountains
In the old days there was no enmity
And in the island common since ancient times
They flew to visit each other
Cranberry by cranberry
Berry by berry cranberry by cranberry
Who knows the land where the sky shines
Inexplicable blue
Where the sea is a warm wave
There is a quiet splash around the ruins
Where is the eternal laurel and cypress
They grew proudly in the wild
Where the majestic Torquato sang
Where and now in the darkness of the night
Adriatic wave
His octaves are repeated
Where Raphael painted
Where is Canova's chisel these days
The obedient marble was revived
And Byron is a stern martyr
Suffered loved and cursed
Magic land Magic land
The land of high inspirations
Ludmila sees your ancient paradise
Your prophetic shadow
On the shores of luxurious waters
At times of carnival orgies
There are people boiling around her
She is greeted with admiration
Lyudmila with northern beauty
All together languid and alive
Captivates the sons of Ausonia
And involuntarily it captivates
Their colorful waves follow behind them
To the paradise of midday nature
To the sparkle of the skies to the clear waters
On the wonders of the silent arts
In the constraint of inspired feelings
Ludmila raises her bright gaze
Marveling and rejoicing in soul
And nothing in front of me
She doesn't find herself more beautiful
Is it worth it with importance of eyes
Before Florentine Cypris
There are two of them and there is marble in front of her
It seems he suffers from resentment
Full of sublime dreams
Does she look in silence
On the image of the gentle Fornarina
Or young Madona
She is a thoughtful beauty
More charming than a painting
Tell me which singer
Burning with delight and emotion
Whose brush whose fiery chisel
Will bequeath to astonished descendants
Her heavenly features
Where are you nameless sculptor
Goddesses of Eternal Beauty
And you crowned by Charita
You are an inspired Raphael
Forget the young Jewish woman
The cradle of the infant god
Experience unearthly beauty
Find joy in heaven
Write us another Maria
With another baby in her arms
To you dear old Muses
The cap was tied in good time
And having attached rattles to it
Phoebus himself put it on you
I wanted to wear the same outfit
To show off in front of you today
And in a frank conversation
How do you look at things
But my old cap is worn out
Even though the poet loved him
He was involuntarily abandoned by me
Red is not a fashionable color these days
So as a sign of peaceful greetings
Taking off my hat I bow my head
Having recognized the philosopher-poet
Under a careful hood
Alas the language of love is talkative
The language is incomplete and simple
With your careless prose
My angel is bothering you
But sweet to the ear of a sweet maiden
Ambitious Apollo
She loves measured chants
The proud ringing of rhymes is sweet to her
You are afraid of the confession of love
You will tear up the letter of love
But a poetic message
You will read it with a tender smile
Blessed be you from now on
A gift entrusted to me by fate
Until now in the desert of life
Feeding the heat of my heart
He brought one persecution upon me
 
Or slander or imprisonment
And rarely cold praise
Why your wonderful pencil
Draws my Arab profile
Even if you betray him to the ages
Mephistopheles will boo him
Draw Olenina's features
In the heat of heartfelt inspirations
Only youth and beauty
A genius must be a fan
When the noisy day becomes silent for a mortal
And on the silent hailstorms
A translucent shadow will fall on the night
And sleep is the reward of daytime labors
At that time for me they drag on in silence
Hours of agonizing vigil
In the inaction of the night the brighter lights burn within me
Snakes of the heart's remorse
Dreams boil in the mind suppressed by melancholy
The excess of heavy thoughts is crowding in
The memory is silent before me
He unfurls his long scroll
And reading my life with disgust
I tremble and curse
And I complain bitterly and shed bitter tears
But I don’t wash away the sad lines
You are empty you are heartfelt
She changed it by mistake
And all the happy dreams
Aroused in the soul of a lover
I stand before her thoughtfully
I can't take my eyes off her
And I tell her how sweet you are
And I think how I love you
A gift in vain a gift by chance
Life why were you given to me
Or why by a secret fate
You are condemned to death
Who is my hostile power
From insignificance he called
Filled my soul with passion
The mind was troubled by doubt
There is no goal in front of me
The heart is empty the mind is idle
And it torments me with longing
The monotonous noise of life
I don't like fashion albums
Their dazzling mixture
Aspasia of our noble
Proclaims only arrogance
Album of a county beauty
Album home and simple
Sweeter with kind talkativeness
And with simple motleyness
Neither here nor there I can say boldly
I don't want to show up though
But your album is a different matter
I willingly pay tribute to him
To you the pets of Apollo
It is not out of vanity that he is open
You love the queens of Helicon
And he himself is not forgotten by them
I enter it as a direct poet
Like a friendly pleasant home
Having honored the owner with greetings
And lar with a prayerful verse
Cold winds are still blowing
And the morning frosts bring
Just now on the spring thawed patches
Early flowers have appeared
As if from a wonderful kingdom of wax
From the fragrant honey cell
The first bee flew out
Flew through the early flowers
To explore the red spring
Will the dear guest be here soon
Will the meadows turn green soon
Will the curly birch tree soon
Sticky leaves will bloom
The fragrant bird cherry will bloom
Young mare
Honor of the Caucasian Taurus
Why are you rushing so boldly
And it's time for you too
Don't glance with a timid eye
Don't throw your feet in the air
In a field smooth and wide
Don't jump willfully
Wait I'll make you
I will humble myself under me
I will direct your run into a measured circle
With a shortened bridle
She is sweet I will say between us
The thunderstorm of court knights
And it is possible with southern stars
Compare especially with verses
Her Circassian eyes
She wields them boldly
They burn brighter than fire
But admit it yourself it's a different matter
My Deer's Eyes
What a thoughtful genius they have
And how much childish simplicity
And how many languid expressions
And how much bliss and dreams
Lelya will put them down with a smile
In them there is a triumph of modest graces
The angel will raise Raphael
This is how the deity contemplates
Don't sing in front of me beauty
You are the song of sad Georgia
They remind me of
Another life and a distant shore
Alas they remind me
Your cruel chants
And the steppe and the night and the moon
Features of a distant poor maiden
I am a ghost my dear fatal one
When I see you I forget
But you sing in front of me too
I imagine him again
Don't sing in front of me beauty
You are the songs of sad Georgia
They remind me of
Another life and a distant shore
I've been meaning to come to you for a long time
To the German city sung by you
Drink with you like poets drink
The wine you sang about
He was already inviting me to come with him
Kiselev glorified by you
And I am with a cheerful soul
I was completely ready to leave
The captivity of the Neva banks
And what about the Heraldic concerns
They grabbed me by the hem
And at least there is no hunting on the Neva
I remained chained
Oh youth youth is daring
Can I not feel sorry for you
I used to be drowning in debt
Creditors running away
I was ready to fly everywhere
Now I visit it annoyingly
Your lazy debtors
Having settled down I curse
I am the weight of money and years
Forgive me singer play feast
Celebrate with Phoebus and Cypris
Don't know the illustrious arrogance
Don't know kind debtors
And don't pay your debts
By right of the Russian nobility
With your burning soul
With their stormy passions
O wives of the North among you
She is sometimes
And past all the conditions of light
Strives until exhaustion
Like a lawless comet
In the calculated circle of the luminaries
Your confessions of tender complaints
I greedily catch every cry
Of mad and rebellious passions
How delightful is language
But stop your stories
Tai Tai your dreams
I'm afraid of their fiery infection
I'm afraid to find out what you knew
In the green steppes of Budjak
Where is the Prut the treasured river
Goes around Russian possessions
At the poor mouth of the stream
There is an unknown village
Bulgarian families are here
They live in carefree wildness
Keeping parental morals
Feeding on labor
And they don't care about it
How the powers fight
And menacingly rule their fate
And on rainy days
They were going to
Often
They bent them
From fifty
One hundred
And they won
And they wrote back
With chalk
So on rainy days
They were busy
Business
There are clouds above me again
Gathered in silence
Fate envious of misfortune
Threatens me again
Will I retain contempt for fate
Shall I carry it to meet her
Steadfastness and patience
Of my proud youth
Tired of a stormy life
I wait for the storm with indifference
Maybe still saved
I will find a pier again
But sensing separation
The inevitable terrible hour
Squeeze your hand my angel
I'm in a hurry for the last time
Angel meek and serene
Quietly say forgive me
Sadden your tender gaze
Raise or lower
And your memory
Will replace my soul
Strength pride hope
And the courage of youthful days
The children came running into the hut
In a hurry they call for their father
Oh my our networks
They dragged in a dead man
Lie lie you little devils
The father grumbled at them
Oh these kids of mine
You'll be a dead man already
The court will come answer me
I'll never figure this one out
There's nothing to do mistress
Give me your caftan and I'll trudge along
Where is the dead man There's dad here
Indeed by the river
Where the wet seine is spread
The dead is visible on the sand
Disgusting horrible corpse
Turned blue and swelled up all over
Is the unfortunate man a poor fellow
Destroyed his sinful spirit
Is the fisherman taken by the waves
Ali is a drunken fellow
Al was robbed by thieves
The slow-witted merchant
What does a man care
Looking around he hurries
He is a sunken body
He drags me into the water by my feet
And from the steep bank
Pushed him away with an oar
And the dead man floated down again
Behind the grave and the cross
Long dead between the waves
He swam swaying as if alive
Seeing him off with my eyes
Our man went home
You puppies follow me
You'll get a kalach
Just be careful not to blab
Or else I'll beat you up
The weather became noisy at night
The river was agitated
The torch has already burned out
In the man's smoky hut
The children are sleeping the hostess is dozing
The husband is lying on the sleeping platform
The storm howls suddenly he heeds
Someone is knocking on the window
Who's there Hey let me in master
Well what's the problem
Why are you wandering around at night Cain
The devil brought you here
Where should I mess around with you
The house is cramped and dark
And with a lazy hand
He raises the window
The moon is rolling from behind the clouds
What is naked in front of him
Water is dripping from his beard
The gaze is open and motionless
Everything in him was terribly numb
Hands dropped down
And into the swollen body
The black crayfish have dug in
And the man slammed the window
Recognizing the naked guest
So I froze and you burst
He whispered trembling
His thoughts were terribly mixed up
He shook all night long
And until the morning they kept knocking
Under the window and at the gate
There is a terrible rumor among the people
They say that every year
Since then the man has been unhappy
On the appointed day the guest awaits
The weather has been angry since morning
At night the storm comes
And the drowned man knocks
Under the window and at the gate
Rhyme sonorous friend
Inspired leisure
Inspired work
You fell silent and became speechless
Oh have you already flown away
Changed forever
In the old days your sweet babble
Calmed the heart's trembling
Lulled my sorrow to sleep
You caressed you beckoned
And took me away from the world
Into the enchanted distance
You used to listen to me
I ran after my dream
Like an obedient child
That's free and jealous
Willful and lazy
I argued with her jokingly
I never parted with you
How many times have I obeyed
To your frisky whims
Like a good-natured lover
Indulgently obedient
I was tormented and loved
Oh when would you come
In the days when the sky was crowded
Olympic Family
You would live with her
And it would shine divinely
Your pedigree
Taking the divine lyre
This is how they would tell the world
Hesiod or Homer
Phoebus once visited Admetus
Near shady Taygetos
The herd was herded by gloomy and sire
He wandered in the darkness of the forest
And no one is afraid of Zeus
Of the goddesses or of the gods
They didn't dare visit him
God of the lyre and flute
God of light and poetry
Remembering the first dates
To ease his suffering
Mnemosyne flowed in
And Apollo's friend
In the quiet grove of Helicon
The fruit of delight has been born
A raven flies to a raven
A crow cries to a crow
Raven where should we dine
How can we find out about this
A raven answers a raven
I know we'll have lunch
In an open field under a willow tree
The hero lies dead
Who killed him and from what
Only the falcon knows him
Yes a black filly
Yes the mistress is young
The falcon flew away into the grove
An enemy mounted the mare
And the hostess is waiting for her darling
Not killed alive
The city is lush the city is poor
The spirit of bondage is a slender appearance
The vault of heaven is green and pale
Boredom cold and granite
Still I feel a little sorry for you
Because here sometimes
A little leg is walking
A golden curl curls
Take it take it don't be sorry
It's more fun to travel with me
I'll have raisins
Doesn't come to mind
Zuckerbrod
Doesn't fit in mouth
The pastila is not good
Without you my soul
In the cool sweetness of the fountains
And the walls are splashed all around
The poet used to amuse the khans
Poems like rattling pearls
On the thread of idle fun
He brought it down with a cunning hand
Transparent flattery necklace
And the beads of golden wisdom
The sons of Saadi loved Crimea
Sometimes the eastern talker
Here I developed my notebooks
And Bakhchisarai surprised
His stories were spread out
Like the Erivan carpets
And they were brightly decorated with them
Gireev Khan's feasts
But no wizard is cute
Possessor of mental gifts
I have never imagined it with such force
So cunningly fairy tales and poems
How insightful and winged
Poet of that wonderful side
Where men are formidable and shaggy
And the wives are equal to the houris
The palace shone the chorus thundered
Singers to the sound of flutes and lyres
Queen in voice and gaze
She enlivened her lavish feast
Hearts rushed to her throne
But suddenly over the golden cup
She thought about it and looked down
Her wondrous head drooped
And the sumptuous feast seems to be dozing
The guests are silent The choir is silent
But again she raises her brow
And he speaks with a clear look
In my love there is bliss for you
Bliss can be bought for you
Listen to me I can equality
Between us I will restore
Who will begin the passionate bargaining
I sell my love
Tell me who among you will buy it
At the cost of my life my night
Advertising and horror embraces everyone
And hearts trembled with passion
She listens to the confused murmur
With a cold insolent face
And a disdainful glance casts its gaze
Surrounded by his admirers
Suddenly one comes out of the crowd
Following him and two others
Their steps are bold their eyes are clear
She stands up to meet them
It's done three nights bought
And the death bed calls them
Blessed by the priests
Now from the fatal urn
In front of motionless guests
The lots come out in succession
And the first Flavius is a brave warrior
In the Roman squads gray-haired
He couldn't bear it from his wife
Arrogant contempt
He accepted the challenge of pleasure
How he received during the war
He is a challenge to a fierce battle
Behind him is Crito the young sage
Born in the groves of Epicurus
Crito the admirer and singer
Charit of Cypris and Amur
Dear to the heart and eyes
Like a spring flower barely developed
The last name for centuries
Didn't convey His cheeks
The first fluff gently shaded
Delight shone in his eyes
The inexperienced power of passions
Boiled in the young heart
And she stopped her sad gaze
The queen is proud on it
I swear by the mother of pleasures
I serve you in an incredible way
On the bed of passionate temptations
I'm starting out as a simple mercenary
Listen mighty Cypris
And you are the kings of the underworld
O gods of the terrible Hades
I swear until the morning dawn
My masters of desire
I will tire you out voluptuously
And with all the secrets of kissing
And I will satisfy you with wondrous bliss
But only with morning purple
The eternal aurora will shine
I swear under the mortal axe
The head of the lucky ones will fall away
And now the day has disappeared
The golden-horned moon rises
The Alexandrian Palace
Covered by a sweet shadow
The fountains are beating and the lamps are burning
Light incense is burning
And voluptuous coolness
The earthly ones are preparing for the gods
In luxurious gloomy peace
Amidst seductive wonders
Under the shade of purple curtains
The golden bed shines
In the desert stunted and stingy
On the soil scorched by the heat
Anchar as a formidable sentry
Stands alone in the whole universe
Nature of the thirsty steppes
She gave birth to him on the day of wrath
And the greenery of the dead branches
And she filled the roots with poison
Poison drips through its bark
By midday melting from the heat
And freezes in the evening
Thick transparent resin
Not even a bird flies to him
And the tiger does not come only a black whirlwind
The tree of death will run up
And the already pernicious one rushes away
And if the cloud pours water
His dense leaf wanders
Its branches are already poisonous
The rain flows into the burning sand
But man is man
He sent an imperious glance to the upas tree
And he obediently set off on his way
And in the morning he returned with poison
He brought the deadly resin
Yes a branch with withered leaves
And sweat on the pale brow
Flowed in cold streams
He brought it and weakened and lay down
Under the vault of the hut on the bast
And the poor slave died at his feet
Invincible Lord
And the prince fed him with that poison
Your obedient arrows
And with them he sent death
To neighbors in foreign lands
In vain the fiery poet
You bring me your wonderful cup
And you ask for a drink to health
I don't drink my dear neighbor
A dear but cunning comrade
Your cup is not full of wine
But with intoxicating poison
He will lure me later
You're on your way to glory again
Isn't he an experienced hussar
Recruiting a recruit brings
Bacchus's joyful gift to him
While the warlike frenzy
It won't knock him down on the spot
I myself am a servant to me at home
It's time to retire
Stay in the ranks of Parnassus
Before the action fill the cup
And Corneille or Tassa laurel
Reap one with a hangover
Both distrustfully and greedily
I look at your flowers
Who will accept the strict stoic with coldness
Hello Harit and beauty
I'm proud of him but also shy
Your unspoken reproach
I don't dare to figure it out at all
Have I really incurred your wrath
Oh how much torment I would have prepared for myself
The windy zoilus of beauties
When would treacherously slander
This floor which he served
Love with madness and excitement
He would have been punished and you
I would always be a refutation
His sad slander
A dried flower without scent
Forgotten in the book I see
And now it’s a strange dream
My soul was filled
Where did it bloom when in what spring
And how long did it bloom and was plucked by someone
By a stranger's or familiar hand
And why was it put here
In memory of a tender meeting
Or a fatal separation
Or a lonely walk
In the silence of the fields in the shade of the forest
And is he alive and is she alive
And now where is their corner
Or have they already faded
Like this unknown flower
Bearded elder Avdey
With respect to my lady
Instead of a red egg
Brought up the learned starling
Do you know this bird
Smarter than any wise man
The starling puffed up majestically
Sighed for the kingdom of heaven
And he spoke with a lisp
Christ is risen Christ is risen
I fly with my heart
In Tver in Moscow
How fast in the field around the open
My horse is shod again and runs
How loudly under his hoof
The frozen earth sounds
Good for Russian health
Our fortifying frost
The cheeks are brighter than spring roses
They play with cold and blood
The forest and the withered valley are sad
The day will come and it will be dark
And as if a belated traveler
The storm is knocking at our window
A poet by the inspired lyre
He jingled his absent-minded hand
He sang cold and arrogant
There are uninitiated people all around
He listened to him senselessly
And the stupid mob talked
Why does he sing so loudly
In vain striking the ear
To what goal is he leading us
What does strumming teach us
Why do hearts worry and torment
Like a wayward sorcerer
His song is as free as the wind
But like the wind and barren
What good is it to us
Be silent senseless people
The day laborer is a slave to the needs of cares
I can't stand your insolent murmur
You are a worm of the earth not a son of heaven
You would benefit from everything by weight
Idol you value Belvedere
You don't see any benefit in it
But this marble is a god so what
The stove pot is more important to you
You cook your food in it
No if you are heaven's chosen one
His gift is the divine messenger
Use it for our benefit
Correct the hearts of your brothers
We are cowardly we are treacherous
Shameless evil ungrateful
We are cold-hearted eunuchs
Slanderers slaves fools
Vices nest in us like a club
You can love your neighbor
Give us bold lessons
And we will listen to you
Go away what's the matter
To the peaceful poet before you
Become stone in debauchery boldly
The voice of the lyre will not revive you
You are as disgusting to the soul as coffins
For your stupidity and malice
Have you had it until now
Scourges of the dungeon axes
Enough of you crazy slaves
In your cities from the noisy streets
Useful work sweeps away the rubbish
But having forgotten his service
Altar and Sacrifice
Do your priests take your broom
Not for everyday worries
Not for profit not for battles
We are born to be inspired
For sweet sounds and prayers
What I was before so am I now
Carefree amorous You know friends
Can I look at beauty without emotion
Without timid tenderness and secret excitement
Love has played a small role in my life
Haven't I fought enough like a young hawk
In the deceptive nets spread by Cypris
And not corrected by a hundredfold insult
I bring my prayers to the new idols
You are spoiled by nature
She was partial to you
And our eternal praise
You find it a boring ode
You yourself have known for a long time
It's no wonder that I love you
What a tender look you Armida
What a light figure you are Sylphide
What are your scarlet lips
Like a harmonious rose
And our rhymes are our prose
There is noise and bustle before you
But the memory of beauty
It touches our hearts secretly
And the careless writing of lines
I humbly contribute to your album
Perhaps as a keepsake against one's will
The one who sang for you will come to you
In those days like Presnenskoye Field
The fence hasn't been put up yet
Approaching Izhory
I looked up at the sky
And I remembered your looks
Your blue eyes
Although I am sadly enchanted
With your virgin beauty
Even though he's called a vampire
I am in Tver province
But my knees are before you
I didn't dare to bow down
And with loving prayers
I didn't want to disturb you
Getting drunk is unpleasant
The intoxication of secular vanity
I'll probably forget
Your lovely features
Easy movement slenderness
Careful conversation
This modest calmness
A sly laugh and a sly look
If not follow the same trail
To your peaceful lands
I'll come back again in a year
And I'll fall in love before November
I was driving to you living dreams
A playful crowd followed me
And the moon on the right side
My run was accompanied by a zealous
I drove away from other dreams
The soul of the lover was sad
And the moon on the left side
Accompanied me sadly
Eternal dreaming in silence
This is how we poets indulge
So superstitious signs
Agree with the feelings of the soul
In Elysia Vasily Trediakovsky
A most sharp man worthy of much praise
He began working on the magazine with great enthusiasm
Popovsky volunteered to be a member of staff
Elagin promised his articles
Kurganov himself is busy with criticism
The scribe wants to show off his wits again
And they say they will start in the next few days
Blessed be this most useful work
And Vasily Tredyakovsky is just waiting
So that Mikhail Kachenovsky can arrive in time
Cruelly offended by magazines
Zoilus Pakhom was deeply saddened
He filed a denunciation against the censor
But the censor is right we are laughing at Zoilus' nose
Other swearing is of course indecent
You can't write "Such and such an old man"
Goat in glasses puny slanderer
And evil and mean all this will be a person
But you can print for example
That Mr Parnassian Old Believer
In his articles the speaker is nonsense
Excellently dull excellently boring
It's a bit heavy and even a bit stupid
There is no face here only a writer
The Poet-Player on Beverley-Horace
You lost piles of banknotes
And silver is the heritage of the fathers
And horses and even coachmen
And with joy on the card b on the villain
I would put a notebook of my poems
If only your poem would cost at least a penny
Where is ancient Kochergovskiy
He rested over Rollen
Days of the newest Trediakovsky
He conjured and enchanted
The fool turns his back to the sun
Under the cold Herald
Sprinkled dead water
Sprayed the live izhitsa
The night mist lies on the hills of Georgia
Aragva rustles before me
I am sad and light my sorrow is bright
My sorrow is filled with you
You alone you alone my despondency
Nothing torments or worries
And the heart burns again and loves because of that
What it can't help but love
Farewell dear Kalmyk woman
Just a little bit to spite my plans
It's a commendable habit of mine
Didn't captivate me among the steppes
Following your kibitka
Your eyes are certainly narrow
And the nose is flat and the forehead is wide
You don't babble in French
You don't squeeze your legs with silk
In English in front of the samovar
You can't crumble bread with a pattern
Don't you admire Saint-Mars
You don't appreciate Shakespeare a little
Don't get lost in daydreaming
When there is no thought in the head
You don't sing
Gallop don't jump into the meeting
What needs Exactly half an hour
While they were harnessing the horses for me
My mind and heart were occupied
Your gaze and wild beauty
Friends are not all the same
To forget oneself with an idle soul
In a glittering hall in a fashionable box
Or in a nomadic tent
Blessed be your new feat
Your path to the north is our harsh one
Where spring reigns briefly
But where are Hafiza and Saadi
The names are familiar
You will visit our midnight land
Leave a trace
Flowers of Eastern Fantasy
Scattering on the northern snows
Once upon a time there lived a poor knight
Silent and simple
Looks gloomy and pale
Bold and direct in spirit
He had one vision
Beyond comprehension
And deeply impressed
It was etched into his heart
Traveling to Geneva
On the road to the cross
He saw the Virgin Mary
Mother of the Lord Christ
Since then my soul has been burned
He didn't look at women
And to the grave not with one
I didn't want to say a word
Since then the steel grate
He didn't lift his face
And a rosary around your neck
Instead of a scarf he tied it on
There is no prayer to the Father or the Son
Neither the Holy Spirit nor the Holy Spirit ever
It didn't happen to the paladin
He was a strange man
He spent whole nights
Before the face of the Holy One
Turning his sorrowful eyes towards her
Tears flow quietly like a river
Full of faith and love
Faithful to the pious dream with blood
He wrote on the shield
Meanwhile the paladins
Towards the trembling enemies
Across the Plains of Palestine
They rushed naming the ladies
He exclaimed louder than anyone else
And the threat drove him away
Muslims from all sides
Returning to his distant castle
He lived strictly in confinement
Still in love still sad
He died without communion
Meanwhile as it was ending
The evil spirit has arrived
The knight's soul was collected
The demon is already dragged to its limit
He didn't pray to God
He didn't know fasting
It was not the right way to drag yourself along
He is after the mother of Christ
But the most pure heart
I stood up for him
And let into the kingdom of eternity
His paladin
Don't be captivated by the glory of war
O handsome young man
Don't rush into a bloody battle
With the Karabakh crowd
I know death will not meet you
Azrael among the swords
Your beauty will be noticed
And she will be spared
But I'm afraid among the battles
You will lose forever
Modesty of timid movements
The charm of bliss and shame
Crito the luxurious citizen
Charming Athens
In the prime of life he indulged
To all the delights of being
One day listen friends
He wandered around Keramik
And suddenly from the age-old grove
Shining with virginal beauty
In light and simple clothes
A young nymph appeared
In front of the bathhouse between the columns
She paused for a moment
And she entered the house motionless
Looks at the door like a dream
His beauty has disappeared
Here we crossed the Kokushkin bridge
Leaning on granite
Alexander Sergeich Pushkin himself
Standing with Mr Onegin
Without even looking at him
The stronghold of fatal power
He stood proudly with his back to the fortress
Don't spit in the well my dear
The belly button turns black through the shirt
The tit looks cute on the outside
Tatyana crumples a piece of paper in her hand
Zane's stomach hurts
She then got up in the morning
In the pale rays of the moon
And she tore it up to wipe her ass
Of course Nevsky Almanac
When to the city of Constantine
With you is a warlike Varangian
The Slavic squad has arrived
And raised the banner of victory
Then to the glory of military Rus'
To the obstinate Greek in shame and fear
You nailed your damask shield
At the Constantinople Gate
The days of bloody feud have come
We have found your path again
But today when we are again with glory
They started to flow menacingly towards Istanbul
Your hill shook with a battle roar
Your jealous groan confused us
And our army before Istanbul
Your old shield stopped
Like a nameless satire
I stained the face of Zoilus
I confess to the abusive challenge
I didn't expect any objections
Are these rumors true
He answered: Is it exactly so
In receiving a slap in the face
My fool signed
Once again we are crowned with glory
Once again the boastful enemy is defeated
The bloody dispute in Arzrum has been resolved
Peace was proclaimed in Edirne
And Russia moved on
And the south was solemnly embraced
And half of Euxine was involved
Into your tight embrace
Rise up oh Greece rise up
It was not for nothing that I strained my strength
It was not for nothing that the abuse shook
Olympus and Pindus and Thermopylae
Under the shadow of their ancient peaks
Young freedom has arisen
On the tombs of Pericles
On the marble Athens
The land of heroes and gods
Broke the slave chains
While singing fiery verses
Tyrtaeus of Byron and Riga
The dawn is being beaten from my hands
Old Dante falls out
A verse has begun on the lips
The unread one fell silent
The spirit flies far away
The sound is familiar the sound is alive
How often have you been heard
Where it developed quietly
I have been there for a long time
You are happy in the lovely fools
In the service of cards and feasts
in cartoons
You are Neledinsky in verse
You were shot in a duel
You are cut to pieces in war
At least you are a hero indeed
But you are quite a rake
Hoping for my contempt
The gray-haired Zoilus scolded me
And having already lost patience
I responded with an epigram
Bitten by the desire for glory
Now hoping for an answer
The magazine jester is a crafty serf
I would also start scolding Oh no
Let him be like a demon before mass
He gives himself no peace
Footman sit in the hallway
And will there be a settlement with the master
I was also among the Don Cossacks
I also chased away a gang of Ottomans
In memory of the battle and the tents
I brought a whip home
On a campaign in war
I saved the balalaika
Next to her on the wall
I'll hang the whip too
What to hide from friends
I love my mistress
I often thought about her
And he took care of his whip
The picture was once looked at by a shoemaker
And he pointed out a mistake in the shoes
The artist immediately took up his brush and corrected himself
Here the shoemaker continued hands on his hips
I think the face is a little crooked
And isn't this chest too naked
Here Apelles interrupted impatiently
Judge my friend not above the boot
I have a friend in mind
I don't know what subject he's in
He was an expert although he was strict in words
But the devil take him from judging the world
Let him try to judge boots
Shining among the wide fields
There it is pouring Hello Don
From your distant sons
I brought you my regards
As a renowned brother
Rivers know the quiet Don
From Araxes and Euphrates
I brought you my regards
Having rested from the evil pursuit
Feeling my homeland
The Don horses are already drinking
Arpachay stream
Prepare the cherished Don
For dashing riders
The juice is bubbling and sparkling
Your vineyards
How long will I walk in this world
Sometimes in a carriage sometimes on horseback
Sometimes in a kibitka sometimes in a carriage
Sometimes in a cart sometimes on foot
Not in the ancestral den
Not among the graves of our fathers
I know the big road
The Lord judged me to die
On the stones under the hoof
On the mountain under the wheel
Or in a ditch washed away by water
Under the dismantled bridge
Or the plague will catch me
Or the frost will ossify
Or a barrier will hit me in the forehead
The clumsy invalid
Or in the forest under the knife of the villain
I'll get caught on the sidelines
Or I'll die of boredom
Somewhere in quarantine
How long will I be in hungry anguish
To observe an involuntary fast
And cold veal
Yara truffles to remember
It's a different matter to be in place
Driving along Myasnitskaya
About the village about the bride
To think in one's free time
A glass of rum is a different matter
Sleep at night tea in the morning
It's a different matter with brothers at home
Well go and chase!
The wind is blowing fair the ship is sailing
The flags were spread out to their full length and swelled
The sails are still moving and in front of the stern
Sea foam is distributed to many
All the swimmers' chests filled up
Now that the dangerous path has been completed
They saw their native land again
One stands looking into the distance
And in dark sketches he draws for him
Dream long familiar objects
The bay and the cape are still motionless eyes
They won't hurt another comrade
Shakes hands and greets the fatherland
And the gentlemen thanked him with tears in their eyes
Another silently performing prayer
To the Saint and the Holy Virgin
And alms and distant worship
Ancient vows are renewed
When he finds everything is safe
Thoughtful mute and distant from everyone
Medok himself is immersed in memories
About the glorious feat then in dreams of hope
Then in sorrowful forebodings and fear
A beautiful evening and a fair wind
Sounds between the ropes and the ship is reliable
Runs noisily between the waves
The sun is setting
White-sided Chatterbox
Under my gate
A motley magpie is jumping
And he prophesies guests for me
An unprecedented bell
My ears are ringing
At the scarlet dawn
The snow dust turns silver
Winter What should we do in the village I meet
The servant who brings me a cup of tea in the morning
Questions about whether the snowstorm has died down or not
Is there powder or not and can I go to bed
Leave for the saddle or better before lunch
Messing around with your neighbor's old magazines
Powder We get up and immediately mount our horse
And trot across the field at the first light of day
The whips in the hands of the dog follow us
We look at the pale snow with diligent eyes
We're spinning and prowling and sometimes it's late
Having killed two birds with one stone we come home
How fun it is! Here in the evening the snowstorm howls
The candle burns darkly embarrassed the heart aches
Drop by drop I slowly swallow the poison of boredom
I want to read my eyes slide over the letters
And my thoughts are far away I close the book
I take a pen sit and forcibly pull it out
The sleeping muse has incoherent words
The sound does not go to the sound I lose all rights
Above the rhyme above my strange servant
The verse drags on languidly cold and foggy
Tired with the lyre I stop arguing
I go to the living room and hear a conversation there
About the upcoming elections about the sugar factory
The hostess frowns like the weather
Moving the steel needles nimbly
Or the king is guessing about the red one
Longing So day after day goes by in solitude
But if in the evening in a sad village
When I sit in the corner playing checkers
He will come from afar in a kibitka or a cart
Unexpected family old woman two girls
Two blonde two slender sisters
How the Blind Side Comes to Life
How life oh my god becomes full
At first indirectly-attentive glances
Then a few words and then conversations
And there is friendly laughter and songs in the evening
And lively waltzes and whispers at the table
And languid glances and frivolous speeches
On the narrow staircase slow meetings
And the maiden comes out onto the porch at dusk
Her neck and chest are open and the snowstorm is in her face
But the storms of the north are not harmful to the Russian rose
How hotly the kiss burns in the frost
How fresh the Russian maiden is in the dust of snow
Frost and sun a wonderful day
You are still dozing my lovely friend
It's time beauty wake up
Open your eyes closed in bliss
Towards the Northern Aurora
Become the star of the north
Last night do you remember the snowstorm was angry
The haze was hovering in the cloudy sky
The moon is like a pale spot
Through the dark clouds it turned yellow
And you sat there sad
And now look out the window
Under the blue skies
With magnificent carpets
The snow lies glittering in the sun
The transparent forest alone turns black
And the spruce turns green through the frost
And the river sparkles under the ice
The whole room is amber-colored
Illuminated by a Merry Crackling
The flooded stove crackles
It's nice to think at the couch
But you know shouldn't I order it into the sled
To harness the brown filly
Sliding on the morning snow
Dear friend let's indulge in running
impatient horse
And we will visit the empty fields
The forests were recently so dense
And the shore is dear to me
Gray Svistov you reigned with glory
It's time to lay down your crown
Your pet is young blooming and healthy
You will be replaced by our great singer
Behold the venerable interlocutor listens to me
The arbitrariness of fate is being carried out
His young heir is
Svistov ascends the throne
The boy offered a hymn to Phoebus
There is a hunt but little brain
And how old is he I ask
Fifteen Just then Hey rod
For this the seminarian brought
Notebook of lackey dissertations
And Horace read aloud to Phoebus
Biting the lips the first leaf
Feeling heavy as if from a drug
Phoebus interrupted him angrily
And immediately a grown-up blockhead
He ordered to put it in sticks
I loved you love may still be
In my soul it has not completely died out
But don't let it bother you anymore
I don't want to sadden you with anything
I loved you silently hopelessly
We are tormented by timidity and jealousy
I loved you so sincerely so tenderly
May God grant you to be loved differently
Confused by memories
Filled with sweet melancholy
Gardens are beautiful under your sacred twilight
I enter with my head down
So the Bible's youth is a mad squanderer
Having drained the phial of repentance to the last drop
Having finally seen my native abode
His head sank and he began to sob
In the heat of fleeting delights
In the fruitless whirlwind of vanity
Oh how much have I squandered the treasures of my heart
For unattainable dreams
And for a long time I wandered and often tired
With remorse of grief foreseeing troubles
I thought about you blessed limit
I imagined these gardens
I imagine a happy day
When did the lyceum arise among you
And I hear the playful noise of our games again
And I see my family of friends again
Again as a gentle youth sometimes ardent sometimes lazy
Vague dreams are lurking in my chest
Wandering through the meadows through the silent groves
I forget myself as a poet
And in reality I see before me
Proud traces of days past
Still filled with the Great Wife
Her favorite gardens
They stand inhabited by palaces with gates
Pillars towers idols of gods
And with marble glory and copper praises
Ekaterininsky eagles
The ghosts of heroes sit down
At the pillars dedicated to them
Look here is a hero a suppressor of military formations
Perun of the Kagul shores
Here is the mighty leader of the midnight flag
Before whom the seas fire both swam and flew
Here is his faithful brother the hero of the Archipelago
Here is the Navarino Hannibal
Among the holy memories
I grew up here since childhood
And meanwhile the flow of popular abuse is muffled
He was already raging and grumbling
Nrzb embraced bloody care
Russia moved and passed us by incomprehensibly
And clouds of horse-borne bearded infantry
And the bright rows of guns
The young warriors were looked upon with envy
We caught the distant sound of abuse with greed
And they cursed childhood indignantly
And the strict bonds of science
And many did not come At the sound of new songs
The glorious ones rested in the fields of Borodino
On the Kulm heights in the harsh forests there is no clear way
Near Montmartre illegible
Let's go I'm ready to go wherever you are friends
Wherever you decide to go I am ready to follow you
Follow the arrogant running away everywhere
To the foot of the wall of distant China
Will we finally get there in boiling Paris
Where Tassa no longer sings the night rower
Where the relics of ancient cities slumber under the ashes
Where cypress groves are fragrant
I'm ready to go everywhere Let's go but friends
Tell me will my passion die in my wanderings
Will I forget the proud tormented maiden
Or at her feet her young anger
As a tribute I will bring the usual love
Another high important song
Hear about Phoebus and the silent lyre
In your ruined sanctuary
I'll hang it and it will publish
When the storm shakes its pillars
A sad sound still one hymn
Listen to me I sing to you the penates
Votive Hymn Zeus's Counselors
Do you live in the depths of heaven
Or are the deities supreme over everything
The reason you are in the opinion of the sages
And they follow you solemnly
Great Zeus with his white-headed wife
And the wise goddess maiden of power
Pallas of Athens praise to you
Accept the hymn of the mysterious forces
Although he was long removed by exile
From your sacrifices and silent libations
But the gods never cool down in their love for you
And in the long hours of deserted sadness
I was asking agonizingly to rest
At your holy ashes
My soul is at peace there
So I loved you for a long time I call you
As witnesses with what holy excitement
I left the human race
To guard your secluded fire
Talking to myself Yes
Hours of indescribable pleasures
They let me know the depth of my heart
In his strength and weaknesses
They teach me to love and cherish
Not mortal mysterious feelings
And they teach us science first
Honor yourself Oh no forever
He never ceased to pray reverently
You are the home gods
Do I wander along the noisy streets
When I enter a crowded temple
Am I sitting among crazy youths
I indulge in my dreams
I say the years will fly by
And no matter how much we are seen here
We will all descend under the eternal vaults
And someone's hour is already near
I look at the solitary oak tree
I think of the patriarch of the forests
Will outlive my forgotten age
How did he survive the age of his fathers
Am I caressing a sweet baby
I already think I'm sorry
I give up my seat to you
It's time for me to rot and for you to bloom
Every day every hour
I'm used to seeing things off with thoughts
Coming Death Anniversary
Trying to guess between them
And where will fate send me death
In battle or in wandering in the waves
Or the neighboring valley
Mine will accept the cooled ashes
And even to the insensitive body
Equally decay everywhere
But closer to the cute limit
I always wanted to rest
And let it be at the entrance to the grave
The young one will play life
And indifferent nature
Shine with eternal beauty
The Caucasus is beneath me alone in the sky
I stand above the snow at the edge of the rapids
An eagle rising from a distant peak
Floats motionless with me on par
From here I see the birth of streams
And the first movement of the terrible avalanches
Here the clouds walk humbly beneath me
Waterfalls cascade through them making noise
Below them are the naked masses of cliffs
There below is moss skinny dry bushes
And there are already green canopies of groves
Where the birds chirp where the deer jump
And there people are already nesting in the mountains
And the sheep crawl along the fertile rapids
And the shepherd descends to the joyful valleys
Where the Aragva rushes along the shady banks
And the poor rider hides in the gorge
Where the Terek plays in fierce joy
Plays and howls like a young beast
Having seen food from an iron cage
And beats against the shore in useless enmity
And licks the cliffs with a hungry wave
In vain there is neither food nor comfort for him
The menacingly silent masses press upon him
Crushing against the dark rocks
The waves roar and foam
And eagles scream above me
And the forest murmurs
And they shine among the wavy haze
Mountain peaks
From there a landslide occurred
And with a heavy crash he fell
And the whole gorge between the rocks
Blocked
And the mighty shaft of the Terek
Stopped
Suddenly exhausted and subdued
O Terek you have stopped your roar
But the persistent anger of the back waves
Snow breakthrough
You flooded enraged
Our shores
And the long-broken collapse
He lay like a melted chest
And the angry Terek ran beneath him
And the dust of the waters
And sprinkled with noisy foam
Ice vault
And a wide path ran along it
And the horse galloped and the ox was drawn
And his camel in the ate
Steppe merchant
Where now only Aeolus rushes
Heaven's dweller
Shootout Behind the Hills
He looks at their camp and ours
On the hill in front of the Cossacks
The red delibash is curling
Delibash don't go near the lava
Have pity on your life
Instantly amen to the dashing fun
You'll get caught on a spear
Hey Cossack don't rush into battle
Delibash at full gallop
Cuts with a crooked saber
Off with your head
They rushed and collided in a common cry
Look at what they are
Delibash is already at its peak
And the Cossack is headless
High above the mountain family
Kazbek is your royal tent
Shines with eternal rays
Your monastery is beyond the clouds
Like an ark hovering in the sky
It hovers barely visible above the mountains
The distant coveted shore
There I would say goodbye to the gorge
Rise to the free heights
There in the cloud-top cell
I will hide in the neighborhood of God
The Terek River flows between the mountains
The wild shore is eroded by waves
It seethes around the huge rocks
Here and there he digs a road
Like a living beast it roars and howls
And suddenly he became calm and humble
Going lower and lower
He's already running barely alive
So after the storm exhausted
The stream of rain flows
And now it's exposed
Its siliceous bed
Scary and boring
There's a housewarming party here
The way and overnight stay
It's cramped and stuffy
In a wild gorge
Clouds and snow
The sky is barely visible
Like from prison
The wind is noisy
The sun is offended
My collection of insects
Open to my friends
What a motley family!
I've been looking for them wherever I can
But what a sorting!
Here is Glinka the ladybug
Here is Kachenovsky's evil spider
Here is Svinin's Russian beetle
Here is the Olinchorn Ant
Here is a small bug
Where there are so many of them
Neatly behind glass and in frames
They are pierced through and through
They stand in a row on epigrams
When your young years
Noisy rumors bring shame
And you are by the verdict of the world
I have lost my right to honor
One among the cold crowd
I share your suffering
And for you with fruitless prayer
I pray to the insensitive idol
But the light of cruel condemnations
He does not change his
He does not punish errors
But it requires a secret for them
Worthy of equal contempt
His vain love
And hypocritical persecution
Prepare your heart for oblivion
Don't drink the poisonous drink
Leave the shiny stuffy circle
Leave the crazy fun
You have only one friend left
You are wrong to see a mistake here
The hand of art has guided
A smile on the marble of these lips
And anger at the cold gloss of the forehead
It is not for nothing that this face is bilingual
Such was this ruler
I am used to counter-feelings
In face and in life a harlequin
Losing language and mind at once
I look at you with one eye
One eye in my head
If only the Fates wanted it
If I had a hundred eyes
Then everyone would look at you
What's in a name
It will die like a sad noise
Waves splashing onto the distant shore
Like a night sound in a deep forest
It's on the memorial sheet
It will leave a dead trace like this
Pattern of the tombstone inscription
In an incomprehensible language
What is in it Long forgotten
In new and rebellious unrest
It won't give it to your soul
Memories pure and tender
But on a day of sadness in silence
Say it with longing
Tell me there is a memory of me
There is a heart in the world where I live
I recognized you my oracle
Not by the patterned diversity
These unsigned scribbles
But according to the cheerful wit
But by the sly greetings
But out of mockery evil
And for such unjust reproaches
And this beauty is alive
With involuntary melancholy and admiration
I'm rereading you
And I exclaim with impatience
It's time to go to Moscow to Moscow now
The city here is prim and dull
Here speeches ice heart granite
There is no sweet frivolity here
Neither muses nor Presnya nor Harit
In hours of fun or idle boredom
I used to play my lyre
Entrusted with pampered sounds
Madness of laziness and passions
But even then the strings of the deceitful
I involuntarily interrupted the ringing
When your voice is majestic
I was suddenly struck
I shed streams of unexpected tears
And the wounds of my conscience
Your fragrant speeches
The pure oil was joyful
And now from the heights of the spiritual
You extend your hand to me
And with gentle and loving power
You tame wild dreams
Your fire burns my soul
Rejected the darkness of earthly vanities
And heeds the harp of the seraphim
In sacred horror the poet
No I do not value rebellious pleasure
With rapture sensual madness frenzy
With the moaning cries of a young bacchante
When you curl up in my arms like a snake
With a rush of ardent caresses and the ulcer of kisses
She hurries the moment of the last shudders
Oh how sweet you are my humble one!
Oh how painfully happy I am with you
When bowing down for long prayers
You surrender yourself to me tenderly without rapture
My delight is shyly cold
You barely answer and don't listen to anything
And then you become more and more animated
And you finally share my flame against your will
The stern Dante did not despise the sonnet
In him the heat of Petrarch's love poured out
The creator of Macbeth loved his play
Camoes clothed them in sorrowful thoughts
And even today it captivates the poet
Wordsworth chose him as his instrument
When away from the bustle of the world
He paints the ideal of nature
Under the shadow of the distant Taurida mountains
The singer of Lithuania in the size of his cramped
He instantly concluded his dreams
Our girls didn't know him yet
As for him Delvig had already forgotten
Hexameter sacred chants
It's not a problem that you're Polish
Kosciuszko Poles Mickiewicz Poles
Perhaps be yourself a Tatar
And here I see no shame
Be a Jew and it's not a problem
It's a shame that you're a Figlarian
The bush rustles on the cliff
The cheerful deer runs out
He is timid in the forest at his feet
From the peak of the sharp one he looks around
Looks at the bright meadows
Looks at the blue vault of heaven
And to the banks of the Dnieper
Crowned by a thicket of trees
He stands immovably built
And he moves his sensitive ear
But he suddenly trembled at the sound
He touched it timidly
He stretched his neck and suddenly
Jumped from the top
Freeing the world from the northern shackles
Only the zephyr blows down on the fields
As soon as the first linden tree turns green
The descendant of Aristippus is welcoming to you
I will come to you and see this palace
Where is the architect's compass palette and chisel
Your learned whim was obeyed
And the inspired competed in magic
You understood the purpose of life a happy person
For life you live your long clear age
You also diversified smartly from a young age
I was looking for a possible moderate mischief
Amusements and ranks came to you in succession
Messenger of the young crowned Wife
You came to Ferney and you are a grey-haired cynic
The leader of minds and fashion sly and bold
Loving his dominion in the North
He greeted you with a grave voice
With you he squandered an excess of joy
You tasted his flattery the drink of the earthly gods
Having said goodbye to Ferney you saw Versailles
Without extending prophetic eyes into the distance
There all rejoiced young Armida
To the joy of luxury the first sign is given
Not knowing what fate has doomed me to
Frolicking in the windy courtyard surrounded
Do you remember Trianon and the noisy fun
But you were not exhausted by their sweet poison
The teaching was done for a time your idol
You secluded yourself for your harsh feast
Sometimes a worshipper of providence sometimes a skeptic sometimes an atheist
Diderot sat down on his shaky tripod
He threw his wig and closed his eyes in delight
And you preached And you listened humbly
Over a slow cup of afey or deist
As a curious Scythian to an Athenian sophist
But London called your attention Your gaze
I diligently dismantled this dual cathedral
Here the onslaught is fiery and there the resistance is harsh
Springs of bold new citizenship
Boredom can be stingy over the Thames
You thought you'd sail further Helpful alive
Like his wonderful hero
The cheerful Beaumarchais shone before you
He guessed you in captivating words
He started talking about legs and eyes
About the bliss of that country where the sky is always clear
Where lazy life passes voluptuously
Like a fervent youth's dream full of delight
Where wives go out onto the balcony in the evening
They look and are not afraid of the jealous Spaniard
They listen with a smile and beckon to the foreigner
And you worried flew to Seville
Blessed land captivating limit
There the laurels sway there the oranges ripen
Oh tell me how the wives can do it there
It is touching to combine piety with love
From under the mantilla a conditional sign is given
Tell me how a letter falls from behind bars
How the sullen aunt's supervision is lulled by gold
Tell me how at twenty years old a lover under the window
Trembling and seething wrapped in a cloak
Everything has changed You saw the whirlwind of the storm
The fall of the whole union of the mind and the furies
The law erected by formidable freedom
Versailles and Trianon under the guillotine
And the fun is replaced by dark horror
The world was transformed by the thunder of new glory
Ferney has long been silent Your friend Voltaire
The vicissitudes of fate are a striking example
Not having calmed down even in the coffin dwelling
Until now he wanders from cemetery to cemetery
Baron d'Holbach Morlet Galliani Diderot
Encyclopedia of Skeptical Parables
And the caustic Beaumarchais and your noseless Casti
All have already passed Their opinions talk passions
Forgotten to others Look around you
Everything new boils destroying the past
Witnesses of yesterday's fall
The younger generations barely came to their senses
Harvesting the late fruit of cruel experiments
They are in a hurry to reduce their income with expenses
They have no time to joke they have lunch at Temira's
Or argue about the verses The sound of a new wonderful lyre
The sound of Byron's lyre could hardly entertain them
One and the same you stepping over your threshold
I am suddenly transported back to the days of Catherine
Book depository idols and paintings
And the graceful gardens testify to me
That you favor the muses in silence
That in idleness you breathe noble air
I listen to you your conversation is free
Full of youth Influence of beauty
You feel it vividly You appreciate it with delight
And the brilliance of Alyabyeva and the charm of Goncharova
Carelessly surrounded by Correggio Canova
You do not participate in worldly unrest
Sometimes you look at them mockingly through the window
And you see a circular rotation in everything
So forgetting the whirlwind of affairs for the muses and idle bliss
In the shadow of porphyry baths and marble chambers
The Roman nobles met their sunset
And from afar a warrior and an orator approach them
Sometimes a young consul sometimes a gloomy dictator
We came for a day or two to relax in luxury
Take a breath about the pier and set off on your journey again
I bless the housewarming
Where is your home idol
You carried it and with it the joy
Free labor and sweet peace
You are happy you have your little house
Keeping the custom of wisdom
From evil worries and sluggish laziness
Insured against fire
When in my arms
I enclose your slender figure
And tender words of love
I lavish upon you with delight
Silent from the constrained hands
Freeing your flexible frame
You answer my dear friend
I smiled incredulously
Keeping it in mind diligently
The sad legends of change
You are without participation and attention
You listen to me sadly
I curse the treacherous efforts
Of my criminal youth
And the expectation of conditional meetings
In the gardens in the silence of the nights
I swear by the whisper of love speeches
The mysterious melody of poetry
And the caresses of gullible girls
And their tears and late murmur
Poet do not value the people's love
The minute noise of rapturous praise will pass
You will hear the judgment of a fool and the laughter of a cold crowd
But you remain firm calm and gloomy
You are the king live alone on the free road
Go where your free mind takes you
Improving the fruits of beloved thoughts
Without demanding rewards for a noble feat
They are in you yourself You are your own supreme court
You know how to evaluate your work more strictly than anyone else
Are you satisfied with him discerning artist
Satisfied so let the crowd scold him
And spits on the altar where your fire burns
And in childish playfulness your tripod sways
Not a multitude of paintings by old masters
I always wanted to decorate my home
So that the visitor would marvel at them superstitiously
Listening to the important opinion of experts
In my simple corner amidst slow labors
I wanted to be a spectator of one painting forever
One so that on me from the canvas as from the clouds
Most Pure and our Divine Savior
She with greatness he with reason in his eyes
The meek looked in glory and in the rays
Alone without angels under the palm of Zion
My wishes have come true Creator
My Madona sent you to me
The purest example of purest charm
Just look at this children
As in the simplicity of the heart
Long Firs plays these
Those those those and those those those
Black-eyed Rosseti
In autocratic beauty
All hearts were captivated by these
Those those those and those those those
Oh what kind of networks are there
Fate lays down its path for us in the darkness
Rhymes money ladies these
Those those those and those those those
Clouds are rushing clouds are swirling
Invisible moon
Lights up the flying snow
The sky is cloudy the night is cloudy
I'm driving in an open field
Bell ding-ding-ding
It's scary it's scary against your will
Among unknown plains
Hey there goes the coachman No strength
The horses are having a hard time master
The snowstorm is blinding my eyes
All the roads are covered in snow
Even if you kill me there is no trace to be seen
We're lost What should we do
It seems the devil is leading us into the field
Let it circle around
Look over there he's playing
Duet spits on me
Now he's pushing into the ravine
Wild horse
There along an unprecedented mile
He was standing in front of me
There he flashed a small spark
And disappeared into the empty darkness
Clouds are rushing clouds are swirling
Invisible moon
Lights up the flying snow
The sky is cloudy the night is cloudy
We don't have the strength to spin around in the future
The bell suddenly fell silent
The horses became What's there in the field
Who knows a stump or a wolf
The blizzard is angry the blizzard is crying
The horses are sensitive and snore
Look how far he jumps
Only the eyes glow in the darkness
The horses galloped again
Bell ding-ding-ding
I see the spirits have gathered
Among the white plains
Endless ugliness
In the muddy month game
Various demons began to swirl
Like leaves in November
How many of them where are they being driven
Why are they singing so plaintively
Is it a brownie that is being buried
Do they marry off a witch
Clouds are rushing clouds are swirling
Invisible moon
Lights up the flying snow
The sky is cloudy the night is cloudy
The demons rush in swarm after swarm
In the boundless heights
With a plaintive squeal and howl
Breaking my heart
The faded joy of crazy years
I feel heavy like a vague hangover
But like wine the sorrow of days gone by
In my soul the older the stronger
My path is sad It promises me work and grief
The turbulent sea of the coming
But I don't want to die for others
I want to live to think and suffer
And I know I will have pleasures
Between sorrows worries and anxieties
Sometimes I get drunk with harmony again
I will shed tears over fiction
And maybe on my sad sunset
Love will flash a farewell smile
Oh whoever you are whose gentle singing
Welcomes my rebirth to bliss
Whose hidden hand firmly shakes my hand
Shows the way and gives the staff
Oh whoever you are an old man or an inspired one
Or a distant comrade of my youth
Or is the youth mysteriously protected by the muses
Or a meek gender a bashful cherub
I thank you with my heart filled with emotion
A solitary object of weak attention
I'm not used to goodwill until now
And his friendly language is strange to me
It's funny who demands participation from the world
The cold crowd looks at the poet
As if he were a visiting buffoon
Will deeply express a heavy heart groan
And the hard-won verse is piercingly sad
It will hit the hearts with an unknown force
She claps her hands and praises or sometimes
Nods his head unkindly
Will the singer be overcome by sudden excitement
The loss is sorrowful exile imprisonment
The better art lovers say
The better he will gain new thoughts and feelings
And the poet's happiness will pass them on to us
There will be no heartfelt greetings between them
When it fearfully remains silent
The long-awaited moment has arrived my many years of work are finished
Why is this incomprehensible sadness secretly troubling me
Or having accomplished my feat I stand like an unnecessary day laborer
The one who accepted his payment was alien to the work of another
Or do I feel sorry for the work of the silent companion of the night
Friend of golden Aurora friend of the saints' penates
The deaf called the deaf to the court of the deaf judge
The deaf man shouted: My cow has been taken away by them
Have mercy cried the deaf man in response
This wasteland was still owned by my late grandfather
The judge decided that there would be no debauchery
Marry the young man even though the girl is to blame
For the last time your image is cute
I dare to caress mentally
Awaken the dream with the power of the heart
And with timid and sad tenderness
To remember your love
Our summers are running and changing
Changing everything changing us
Well you are for your poet
Dressed in grave gloom
And for you your friend has faded away
Accept my distant friend
Farewell of my heart
As a widowed wife
Like a friend hugging a friend in silence
Before his imprisonment
I'll soon be fifteen
Will I live to see the happy day
How he moves me forward
But even now no one will throw me away
Looking at me with disdain
I'm not a boy anymore I'm not talking about a boy anymore
I can pinch my mustache
I am as important as a toothless old man
You hear my voice rough
Try to push me
I am liked by ladies because I am modest
And between them there is one
And her proud gaze is so languid
And the color of her cheeks is so dark
That she is dearer to me than life
She is strict and power-hungry
I myself am amazed at her intelligence
And it's terrible how jealous she is
But she is proud with everyone
And it is available to me alone
In the evening she spoke to me majestically
I swore that if I did it again
Look left and right
Then she will give me the right to poison
This is what her love is like
She's ready to go to the desert
Run away with me defying rumors
Do you want to know my goddess
My Seville Countess
No I won't name it for anything
